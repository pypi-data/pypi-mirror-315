# wL

**wL** is a *markup metalanguage* designed to store arbitrary data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

The design goals of wL emphasize elementary simplicity, generality, stability, and usability across all programming language.
Plus, wL format does not contain no data specialisation or typing, for a linear read.
