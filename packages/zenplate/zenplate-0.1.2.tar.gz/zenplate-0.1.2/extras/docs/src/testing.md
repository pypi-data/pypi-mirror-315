# Testing Zenplate

## Overview

Zenplate uses `pytest` for testing. The tests are located in the `tests` directory. 
The tests typically reside in one test file per source file, with some exceptions (builtin plugins).

The non-sourcecode resources required for running the tests are in the `tests/fixtures` directory.

In addition to fixtures folder, there are also python source files within the `tests` directory having names ending in `fixtures`.
These source files contain functions and objects that are used in the tests.
