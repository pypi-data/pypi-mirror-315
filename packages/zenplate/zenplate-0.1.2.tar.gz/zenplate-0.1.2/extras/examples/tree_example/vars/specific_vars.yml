project_description: |
    - This is an example project that demonstrates how to use the `tree` plugin.
      It is a simple project that generates a directory tree.
  
    - There are two variable files, which are merged as a single variable source.
      This might be useful, as you could use one variable for many projects and another for a specific project.
      You can use as many variable files as you like, this example just uses two.
