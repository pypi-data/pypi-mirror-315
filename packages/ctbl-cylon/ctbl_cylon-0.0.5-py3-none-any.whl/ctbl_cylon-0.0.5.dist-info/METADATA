# Cylon: a simple script to create new accounts

This is a testing package for personal use. Use it at your own risk.

The problem: frequently, after creating a new machine, I have to set up a sort-of service account
to let me do things, like updating stuff, develop, install packages, etc. The process of creating
these accounts becomes tedious. What if we could just treat these profiles as regular git repos,
that could be downloaded as required?

cylon is a script that helps to ease this process. Documentation will be put here as the script
becomes developed and stable.
