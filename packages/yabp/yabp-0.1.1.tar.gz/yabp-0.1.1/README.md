# YABP - Yet another Batch Processor
I wrote this because I needed a generic way to process large data (often in the form of lists) in batches. 
Other libraries are generally more suited for complexer problem and often require more effort to setup and is 
often overkill for small projects. Also provides a decorator for even more simple usage.

Another library that is similar and also accomplish the same goal: https://github.com/gillespied/batch_please/tree/main

This module provides functionality for processing data in batches with options for progress tracking, retries, and saving results to a file. It includes a `BatchProcessor` class and a `batch_processor_decorator` for easy integration into your projects.

## Installation
```
pip install yabp==0.1
```

## Usage

### BatchProcessor Class

1. **Import the BatchProcessor:**

   ```python
   from batchprocessor import BatchProcessor
   ```

2. **Define a function to process each batch:**

   ```python
   def process_batch(batch):
       # Your processing logic here
       return {"processed": batch, "status": "success"}
   ```

3. **Initialize the BatchProcessor:**

   ```python
   processor = BatchProcessor(
       iterable=your_data,
       batch_size=5,
       progress=True,
       save_to_file="output.json",
       retries=2,
       retry_delay=1.0,
   )
   ```

4. **Process the batches:**

   ```python
   results = processor.process(process_batch)
   print("Final Results:", results)
   ```

### Decorator version

1. **Import the decorator:**

   ```python
   from batchprocessor import batch_process
   ```

2. **Decorate your batch processing function:**

   ```python
   @batch_process(
       batch_size=5,
       progress=True,
       save_to_file="output_decorator.json",
       retries=2,
       retry_delay=1.0,
   )
   def process_batch(batch):
       # Your processing logic here
       return {"processed": batch, "status": "success"}
   ```

3. **Call the decorated function with your data:**

   ```python
   process_batch(your_data)
   ```

## Features

- **Batch Processing:** Process data in specified batch sizes.
- **Progress Tracking:** Optionally display a progress bar.
- **Retries:** Automatically retry failed batch processing with a specified delay.
- **Save Results:** Save batch results to a JSON file.
