## Introduction

I was writing my first semester university research report on the implications of quantum computing towards binary algorithms, when I first encountered the facinating concepts found within encryption. This package (currently) supports a mini RSA Key Generator, entirely unsuitable for official encryption over any network transfer protocols, however perfect for anyone wishing to learn and practice encryption and decryption with various algorithms.

## Features

- Methods for directly generating mini(6-10) digit RSA Keys
- Methods to find the multiplicative inverse modulo of a given integer(e) and modulo (n)
- Methods to easily find the greatest common divisor between two integers
- Methods to check if two integers are co-prime
- Methods to generate a co-prime integer given an input integer(n)
