Utilities for providing concurrent access to Qt objects, simplified QSettings storage,
and dynamic widget promotion when loading UI files, in Python Qt applications. Includes
the Fugue icon set, free to use with attribution to Yusuke Kamiyamane, and the Ubuntu
font family (available under the [Ubuntu font
license](https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence)).

* [Documentation](https://qtutils.readthedocs.io)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/qtutils/)
* [Source code (GitHub)](https://github.com/philipstarkey/qtutils)


## Installation

* To install the latest release version, run `pip install qtutils`.

* To install latest development version, clone the GitHub repository and run `pip
  install .` to install, or `pip install -e .` to install in 'editable' mode.


## Summary

`qtutils` is a Python library that provides some convenient features to Python
applications using the PyQt5/PySide6 widget library.

`qtutils` 4.0 dropped support for PySide2. If you need to use PySide2, you may use
`qtutils` 3.1.0 or earlier.

`qtutils` contains the following components:

* `invoke_in_main`: This provides some helper functions to interact with Qt from
  threads.

* `UiLoader`: This provides a simplified means of promoting widgets in `*.ui` files to a
  custom widget of your choice.

* `qsettings_wrapper`: A wrapper around QSettings which allows you to access keys of
  QSettings as instance attributes. It also performs automatic type conversions.

* `icons`: An icon set as a `QResource` file and corresponding Python module. The
  resulting resource file can be used by Qt designer, and the python module imported by
  applications to make the icons available to them. The Fugue icon set was made by
  Yusuke Kamiyamane, and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
  If you can't or don't want to provide attribution, please purchase a royalty-free
  license from http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/

* `Qt`: a PyQt5/PySide6 agnostic interface to Qt that allows you to import qtutils.qt
  instead of PySide6 or PyQt5, and have your code run on both, with some convenience
  aliases to make it easier to write code that works with both libraries. Note that this
  is not a comprehensive abstraction layer like [QtPy](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/)
  and your code will still need to be written in a way generally compatible with both
  libraries if you want to support both.

* `outputbox`: a `QTextEdit` widget for displaying log/output text of an application,
  either by calling methods or by sending data to it over `zeromq`.

* `fonts`: bundled fonts from the Ubuntu font family - call `qtutils.fonts.load_fonts()`
  after instantiating a `QApplication` to add them to the `Qt` font database and make
  them available to your application.


## Using icons with Qt designer

To use the icons from Qt designer, clone this repository, and point Qt designer to the
`.qrc` file for the icons set: `icons/icons.qrc`. Unfortunately Qt desginer saves the
absolute path to this file in the resulting `.ui` file, so if the `.ui` file is later
edited by someone on another system, they will see an error at startup saying the `.qrc`
file cannot be found. This can be ignored and the `.ui` file will still function
correctly, but Qt designer will need to be told the local path to the `.qrc` file before
it can display the icons within its interface.
