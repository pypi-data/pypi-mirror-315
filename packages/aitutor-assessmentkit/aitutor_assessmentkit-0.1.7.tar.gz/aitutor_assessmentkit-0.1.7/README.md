# **`AITutor-AssessmentKit:` An Open-Source Library to Measure Pedagogical Ability of AI Tutors in Educational Dialogues**

---

The `AITutor-AssessmentKit` is the *first* open-source library to enable the pedagogical abilities assessment of large language model (LLM)-powered AI tutors in educational dialogues. This unified framework:

- **Evaluates AI tutor responses** across eight comprehensive dimensions in the context of student error remediation tasks in mathematics.
- **Offers a pluggable and customizable interface** for integrating models and LLM releases from the community.

By providing an efficient, scalable alternative to costly and subjective human evaluations, `AITutor-AssessmentKit` facilitates *on-the-fly* assessment of AI tutors.
