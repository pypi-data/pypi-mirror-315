# I want to build out this file to include functions that preform spatial analysis around the psuedotime 

# first function needs to look at co localization of cell types within radius x along the psuedotime trajectory so "final_avg_pseudotime" what celltypes are next to cells along and how do those proportions change need to make some sort of plot
