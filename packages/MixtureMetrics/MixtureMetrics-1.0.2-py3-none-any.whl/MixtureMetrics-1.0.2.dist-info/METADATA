# MixtureMetrics: Mixture Descriptors Calculator
This Python project calculates an additive scheme for mixture descriptors of multi-component materials. The algorithm processes input from two `.csv` files and computes various mixture descriptors.


## Overview
The algorithm requires two input files:

1. Descriptors File: Contains individual descriptors for each component.
2. Mole Fraction File: Contains mole fraction values for each component in each mixture.
The main function, mixture_descriptors_to_csv, processes these inputs and generates 12 CSV files, each corresponding to a different mixture descriptor metric. 


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need `pip` to install the package.

### Installation
You can install the package in two different ways depending on whether you want to install from the local directory or directly from PyPI:

Option 1: Install from Local Directory
   1. **Download the Package:**
      - Clone the repository or download the ZIP file from GitHub.
      - Extract the contents of the ZIP file.

   2. **Install the Package:**
      - Open a command-line interface (CLI).
      - Navigate to the directory containing the extracted package files.
      - Run the following command to install the package:

      ```bash
      pip install .
      ```
Option 2: Install from PyPI
If you prefer to install the package directly from PyPI, you can use the following command. Make sure to replace 1.0.1 with the desired version number if needed:  

   ```bash
   pip install MixtureMetrics==1.0.1
   ```

## Usage

After installing the package, you can use it in your Python code. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the main function:


```python
from MixtureMetrics import mixture_descriptors_to_csv

# Define file paths
descriptors_file_path = 'path/to/descriptors.csv'
mole_fraction_file_path = 'path/to/mole_fraction.csv'
output_directory = 'path/to/output_directory'  # if output path string is empty or None and not provided,it defaults to use the current working directory and if the provided folder is not existed it creates a folder in the given path or in 1.1.5 working directory

# Call the function
mixture_descriptors_to_csv(descriptors_file_path, mole_fraction_file_path, output_directory)
```

## Arguments
descriptors_file_path: Path to the .csv file containing individual descriptors for each component.
mole_fraction_file_path: Path to the .csv file containing mole fraction values for each component in each mixture.
output_directory: Directory where the 12 output .csv files will be saved.
Output
The code computes and saves 12 different mixture descriptors, each in its own .csv file within the specified output directory.
