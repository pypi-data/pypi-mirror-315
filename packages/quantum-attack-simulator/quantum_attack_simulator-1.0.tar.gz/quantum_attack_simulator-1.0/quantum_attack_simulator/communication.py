Quantum Attack Simulator - Communication Module
-----------------------------------------------
This module is part of the Quantum Attack Simulator project, licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
It simulates natural phenomena and real-world effects that occur in a quantum communication channel, 
focusing on their impact on quantum states during transmission. Unlike the attacker module, this module 
does not simulate malicious activities but models environmental factors.

Key Features:
- Depolarization Noise: Simulates random state flips caused by natural noise in the quantum channel.

Functions:
- apply_depolarization_noise: Introduces depolarization effects by flipping quantum states with a given probability.
