- Data Retrieval: Fetch detailed Census data for specific variables, geographic levels (state, county, or tract), and time periods.
- Trend Analysis: Visualize and analyze temporal trends to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Geographic Integration: Use geocoding to retrieve Census information for specific addresses.
- Custom Reports: Generate PDF or HTML reports summarizing data insights and trends.
