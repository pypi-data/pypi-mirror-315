"""

[License]
content = "This project is licensed under the ${project.license} License."

[directory] # `directory` is a built-in method and will not be listed.
title = "Directory Structure" # Block names are customizable, allowing you to override the default "Directory Structure."
content = "The content displayed below the title."
enable = true # Default is true. Show the directory structure.
exclude_dirs = [".git", "env", "__pycache__", "build", "dist", "src/**/tests"] # Exclude directories from scanning. Supports wildcard patterns.
exclude_files = [".env*"] # Exclude files from scanning. Supports wildcard patterns.
show_files = true # Default is true. Show files in the directory structure.
show_comments = true # Default is true. Show first-line comments in the directory structure.
max_depth = 1  # Optional. Specifies the maximum directory depth to display. Omit this line for no limit.

[env] # `env` is a built-in method and will not be listed.
title = "Environment Variables" # Block names are customizable, allowing you to override the default "Environment Variables."
content = "The content displayed below the title."
enable = false # Default is true. Show the environment with description from the .env file.
env_file = ".env" # Default is ".env". The file to read the environment variables from.
````

# .env file

If block comments are placed above `.env` variables, they should follow this format:
```sh
# Project identification code used for service registration and resource management
PROJECT_ID=tbi-readgen
PROJECT_NAME=ReadGen

# Application runtime environment (dev/stage/prod)
APP_ENV=dev
APP_KEY=secret-key
```
will be displayed as:

### Environment Variables

Project identification code used for service registration and resource management

- `PROJECT_ID`
- `PROJECT_NAME`
