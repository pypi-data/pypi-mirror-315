           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

# Deep Reinforcement Learning Library built on top of Neural Network Libraries

nnablaRL is a deep reinforcement learning library built on top of [Neural Network Libraries](https://github.com/sony/nnabla) 
that is intended to be used for research, development and production.

## Installation

Installing nnablaRL is easy!

```sh
$ pip install nnabla-rl
```

nnablaRL only supports Python version >= 3.8 and [nnabla](https://github.com/sony/nnabla) version >= 1.17.

### Enabling GPU accelaration (Optional)

nnablaRL algorithms run on CPU by default. To run the algorithm on GPU, first install [nnabla-ext-cuda](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-ext-cuda) as follows.
(Replace [cuda-version] depending on the CUDA version installed on your machine.)

```sh
$ pip install nnabla-ext-cuda[cuda-version]
```

```sh
# Example installation. Supposing CUDA 11.0 is installed on your machine.
$ pip install nnabla-ext-cuda110
```

After installing nnabla-ext-cuda, set the gpu id to run the algorithm on through algorithm's configuration.

```py
import nnabla_rl.algorithms as A

config = A.DQNConfig(gpu_id=0) # Use gpu 0. If negative, will run on CPU.
dqn = A.DQN(env, config=config)
...
```

## Features

### Friendly API

nnablaRL has friendly Python APIs which enables to start training with only 3 lines of python code.
(NOTE: Below code will run on CPU. See the above instruction to run on GPU.)

```py
import nnabla_rl.algorithms as A
from nnabla_rl.utils.reproductions import build_classic_control_env

# Prerequisite: 
# Run below to enable rendering!
# $ pip install nnabla-rl[render]
env = build_classic_control_env("Pendulum-v1", render=True) # 1
ddpg = A.DDPG(env, config=A.DDPGConfig(start_timesteps=200))  # 2
ddpg.train(env)  # 3
```

To get more details about nnablaRL, see [documentation](https://nnabla-rl.readthedocs.io/) and [examples](./examples).

### Many builtin algorithms

Most of famous/SOTA deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN, SAC, BCQ, GAIL, etc., are implemented in nnablaRL. Implemented algorithms are carefully tested and evaluated. You can easily start training your agent using these verified implementations.  

For the list of implemented algorithms see [here](./nnabla_rl/algorithms/README.md).

You can also find the reproduction and evaluation results of each algorithm [here](./reproductions).  
Note that you may not get completely the same results when running the reproduction code on your computer. The result may slightly change depending on your machine, nnabla/nnabla-rl's package version, etc.

### Seamless switching of online and offline training

In reinforcement learning, there are two main training procedures, online and offline, to train the agent.
Online training is a training procedure that executes both data collection and network update alternately. Conversely, offline training is a training procedure that updates the network using only existing data. With nnablaRL, you can switch these two training procedures seamlessly. For example, as shown below, you can easily train a robot's controller online using simulated environment and finetune it offline with real robot dataset.

```py
import nnabla_rl
import nnabla_rl.algorithms as A

simulator = get_simulator() # This is just an example. Assuming that simulator exists
dqn = A.DQN(simulator)
# train online for 1M iterations
dqn.train_online(simulator, total_iterations=1000000)

real_data = get_real_robot_data() # This is also an example. Assuming that you have real robot data
# fine tune the agent offline for 10k iterations using real data
dqn.train_offline(real_data, total_iterations=10000)
```

### Visualization of training graph and training progress

nnablaRL supports visualization of training graphs and training progresses with [nnabla-browser](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-browser)!

```py
import gym

import nnabla_rl.algorithms as A
import nnabla_rl.hooks as H
import nnabla_rl.writers as W
from nnabla_rl.utils.evaluator import EpisodicEvaluator

# save training computational graph
training_graph_hook = H.TrainingGraphHook(outdir="test")

# evaluation hook with nnabla's Monitor
eval_env = gym.make("Pendulum-v0")
evaluator = EpisodicEvaluator(run_per_evaluation=10)
evaluation_hook = H.EvaluationHook(
    eval_env,
    evaluator,
    timing=10,
    writer=W.MonitorWriter(outdir="test", file_prefix='evaluation_result'),
)

env = gym.make("Pendulum-v0")
sac = A.SAC(env)
sac.set_hooks([training_graph_hook, evaluation_hook])

sac.train_online(env, total_iterations=100)
```
