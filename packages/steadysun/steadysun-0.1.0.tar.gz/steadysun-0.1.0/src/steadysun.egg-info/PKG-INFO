```python
from steadysun.steadysun_api import SteadysunAPI
from steadysun.forecast import get_forecast

# You can either set your token in your env at "STEADYSUN_API_TOKEN"
# OR use the following line :
SteadysunAPI.set_api_token("YOUR_TOKEN")

forecast_df = get_forecast("SITE_UUID")

forecast_df = get_forecast(
    site_uuid="SITE_UUID",
    time_step=30,
    horizon=2440,
    precision=4,
    fields=["all_sky_global_horizontal_irradiance", "2m_temperature"],
