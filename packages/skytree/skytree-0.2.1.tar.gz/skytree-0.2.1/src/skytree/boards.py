"""
Definition of classes that represent continuous game spaces.

Classes:
LayerContainer(Updateable, Drawable, Collidable): an ad-hoc class to help boards organize draw layers.
Board(Updateable, Drawable, Collidable, KeyCommandReader, GameState): base game space class.
TiledBoard(Board): a board that supports interaction with tiled layers.
PlayerCam(Board): a board with a frame that follows the player around.
OnePlayerTiledBoard(TiledBoard, PlayerCam): combines TiledBoard and PlayerCam

Variables used from config: BOARD_BGCOLOR, CANVAS_DIM

    Extend Updateable, Drawable, Collidable and KeyCommandReader to represent a game space.
    
    Inherits all behaviour from Component, Updateable, Positional, Drawable, Collidable and KeyCommandReader.

    Extends Component.add_component(component).
    
    Organizes draw levels; can hold border policies and music.

    get_frame_borders(margins): return a pygame Rect constructed from the board's frame and the given margins.
