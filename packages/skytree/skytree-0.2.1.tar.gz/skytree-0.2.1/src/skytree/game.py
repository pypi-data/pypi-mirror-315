Definition of the Game class and the GameState interface.

Game: the game manager singleton; the root of the tree.
GameState: interface for an object that can act as a game state.

class Game(Updateable, Drawable, KeyCommandReader, metaclass=Singleton):
    """
    Game manager class. Extends WithState, Drawable and KeyboardPuppet. It is a Singleton.
    
    Inherits all behaviour from Component, Updateable, Positional, Drawable and KeyCommandReader.
    Overrides Drawable.draw(canvas).
    
    Deals with game loop, states and initial configuration.
    A reference to this object is passed to Component init, and will be propagated to all present
      and future components through init and add_component respectively.
    Being a singleton, it can also be accessed through further construction calls (i.e using Game()).
    The reasoning for this (admittedly cumbersome) approach to accessing the Game object is twofold:
    - Propagating a reference through the Component pipeline avoids circular import conflics, especially for command readers.
      Command readers need access to the Game; on the other hand, the game needs to be a Command reader itself.
      This method also ensures that every Component has a reference to the Game after being initialized and connected to the
      game tree without any further work and in a fairly transparent manner.
    - On the other hand, Singleton instantiation allows certain objects (such as a PauseState) to access the Game before
      Component initialization or being connected to the tree if they need to do so.
    
    Public methods:
    toggle_fullscreen(): Toggles fullscreen mode.
    set_event_controller(event, controller): Sets the given controller for the stated event.
    mark_for_destruction(*things): Marks entities passed for destruction at the end of the frame.
    hcf(): Quits the game.
    reset_stage(): program a stage reset to be performed at the bottom of the main loop.
    set_state(state, **kwargs): program a state transition to be performed at the bottom of the main loop.
    enter_active_stage(exit_state): call active_stage.enter() if present.
    exit_active_stage(): call active_stage.exit() if present; otherwise, quit the game.
    run(): Starts the game.
    
    Notes on setters:
    Setting fullscreen will trigger pygame.display.set_mode immediately.
    Setting music will call pygame.mixer to perform the appropriate operation.
    
    Key commands:
    fullscreen: toggles fullscreen mode.
