    A class to keep track of a group of Boards.
    
    Instances are stored on the Game instance as a complement
    to the game state system. They are not components.
    The Stage class stores points of entry into a group of Boards
    (both initial and for the current checkpoint).
    Also keeps track of states to exit to.
    Both entry and exit points include a state to transition to and a label
    to signal the new state with.
    
    Public methods:
    enter(exit_state): transition state with entry information; optionally, update exit_state.
    exit(): transition state to exit_state if present; otherwise, quit the game.
    beat(entry_state, start_label, exit_label): exit the stage with exit information and reset checkpoint.
    
    Notes on setters:
    Setting the checkpoint will deactivate the old one and update point of entry (entry_state and start_label).

        Labels are optional; a state should be able to default if it receives no labels on transitions.
        Exit state is also optional; exit() method will quit the game if there's no exit state.
