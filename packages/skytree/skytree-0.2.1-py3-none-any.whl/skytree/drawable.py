    Extend Positional to draw on every frame.
    
    Inherits all Component and Positional behaviour.
    Extends Component.add_component(component) and Component.remove_component(component).
    
    A component must be Drawable for its own components to be drawn.
    
    Public methods:
    draw(canvas): renders self and components on canvas; called from root on every frame.
    Draw layer manipulation (for these methods, pass a component to apply to them or don't to apply to self):
        get_draw_layer(component): return index on _drawable
        set_draw_layer(idx, component): move to stated index on _drawable
        move_forward(component): move to next position on _drawable
        move_backward(component): move to previous position on _drawable
        move_to_front(component): move to last position on _drawable
        move_to_back(component): move to first position on _drawable
    One-time alignment (for these methods, pass a canvas to use as reference or don't to try and use owner canvas):
        align_left(canvas): align left to given canvas
        align_top(canvas): align top to given canvas
        align_right(canvas): align right to given canvas
        align_bottom(canvas): align bottom to given canvas
        align_center_x(canvas): align horizontal center to given canvas
        align_center_y(canvas): align vertical center to given canvas
        align_center(canvas): align center to given canvas
        align_proportion_x(proportion, canvas): align horizontally to given canvas following proportion
        align_proportion_y(proportion, canvas): align vertically to given canvas following proportion
        align_proportion(proportion, canvas): align to given canvas following proportion
    Alignment on draw time:
        set_align_left(): align left on draw time
        set_align_top(): align top on draw time
        set_align_right(): align right on draw time
        set_align_bottom(): align bottom on draw time
        set_align_center_x(): align horizontal center on draw time
        set_align_center_y(): align vertical center on draw time
        set_align_center(): align center on draw time
        set_align_proportion_x(proportion): align horizontally on draw time following proportion
        set_align_proportion_y(proportion): align vertically on draw time following proportion
        set_align_proportion(proportion): align on draw time following proportion
        clear_alignment_x(): cancel horizontal alignment on draw time
        clear_alignment_y(): cancel vertical alignment on draw time
        clear_alignment(): cancel alignment on draw time
