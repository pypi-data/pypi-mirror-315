"""
Definition of classes that deal with routing and processing events.

EventController(ABC): interface for an object that can process events.
  An object doesn't have to actually be an EventController to be set as such; it just has to implement its methods.
KeyboardReader(EventController): an EventController that can process key presses and releases.
KeyCommandReader(Component): a Component that can process commands comming from a KeyboardReader or hold other components that do so.

EventControllers can send commands for CommandReaders to process.
In order to do that:
- Decide a shared list of argument names and types for commands to recognize.
- Code an EventController that interprets an event and sends a command to its owner (typically, the game manager).
- Code CommandReaders that have methods with name '_command_[command_name]' that define that object's behaviour when receiving such command.
CommandReaders will propagate received commands through their components ONLY WHEN they don't have a corresponding method to process the command.
