"""
A repository of helper functions.

Functions:
nop(): do nothing (to be used as a default argument function).
is_collection(obj): check if obj is "intuitively" a collection.
tupleize(obj): put obj inside a tuple unless it's one itself.
repack2(obj): turn obj into (obj, obj) if it's a single value.
repack4(obj): turn obj into (obj, obj, obj, obj)|(*obj, *obj) if it's a single value or a collection with size 2.
bake_obj(obj): build the object if it's a type or a tuple (type, {kwargs}).
distance(p1, p2): return euclidean distance between given 2D points.
