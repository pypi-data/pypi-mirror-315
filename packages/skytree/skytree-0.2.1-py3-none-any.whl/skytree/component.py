"""
Definition of the base class for tree nodes --the core of the framework.

Component subclasses generally propagate their basic functionalities to their components with shared subclasses.
More specifically:
All Components propagate the game attribute and reset command.
Updateable components propagate update command and delta time.
Drawable components propagate draw command and canvas.
Collidable components propagate collision checks.
CommandReader components propagate commands (but only when they cannot process them themselves).

class Component:
    """
    An object that can be owned by another object and own others itself.
    
    This is the core of the framework. Most of a game's object structure is a tree graph
    and this class handles how the nodes are related. It includes functionality for
    adding name and tags to each object and keeping tracks of its components' name and tags.
    It also includes a data structure for handling object restoration on reset.
    
    Public methods:
    add_component(component): add a component to _component; set self as component's owner.
    remove_component(component): remove a component from _component; set None as component's owner.
    add_persistent_component(component): add a component that will persist on reset.
    remove_persistent_component(component): remove a component and stop it from persisting on reset.
    add_tag(tag): add tag and update owner.
    remove_tag(tag): remove tag and update owner.
    destroy(): remove this object from its previous owner and destroy its components. Use with caution.
    reset(): restore the component's established initial state (see init and reset for details).
    
    Notes on setters:
    Setting owner will call add_component and remove_component as needed.
    Setting name will update owner and raise an exception if the new name's already in use.
    Setting game will propagate through components.
