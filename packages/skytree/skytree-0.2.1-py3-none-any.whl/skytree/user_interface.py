Definition of UI objects and states.

Classes:
Menu(Drawable, KeyCommandReader): a list of selectable options with associated actions.
PauseState(Drawable, KeyCommandReader, GameState): a game state that freezes the current board and can
  go back to it, either to unfreeze it or to exit from it.

Variables used from config: CANVAS_DIM
