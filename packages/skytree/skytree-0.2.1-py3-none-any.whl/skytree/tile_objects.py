"""
Definition of objects that can be used as tiles in a TiledLayer.

Tiles are not Components, but their inheritance structure mirror some core Component behaviours.

Classes:
Tile: the base class for tile objects.
UpdateableTile(Tile): a Tile that can do some work on each frame.
DrawableTile(Tile): a Tile with a visible appearance.
CollidableTile(Tile): a Tile with a Hitbox.
AnimatedTile(DrawableTile, UpdateableTile): a Tile with an animation.
DraColTile(DrawableTile, CollidableTile): combines DrawableTile with CollidableTile.
AniColTile(AnimatedTile, CollidableTile): combines AnimatedTile with CollidableTile.
StartTile(Tile): a Tile with a target position for a sprite to place in.
ExitTile(CollidableTile): a collidable Tile that holds information for state transitions.
PathTile(DrawableTile): a Tile that holds information for a sprite to traverse a space.
StageTile(PathTile, StartTile, Stage): a Tile that both links to a Stage in a map and acts as one.
CheckpointTile(StartTile, CollidableTile): a Tile that has checkpoint functionality for a Stage.
VisibleCheckpointTile(CheckpointTile, DrawableTile): a CheckpointTile with a visible appearance.
SpawnerTile(UpdateableTile): a tile that can spawn sprites.
DraSpaTile(DrawableTile, SpawnerTile): combines DrawableTile with SpawnerTile.
