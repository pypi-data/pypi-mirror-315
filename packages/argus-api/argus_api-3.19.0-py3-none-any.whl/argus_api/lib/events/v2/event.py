    :param str startTimestamp: Restrict search to data after this time.
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

    :param str endTimestamp: Restrict search to data before this time \(epoch millis\)
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

If null we don\'t filter \(default\)
If true we only return production customers
If false\, we exclude all production customers

    :param list endpoint: Restrict search to events with endpoints matching these criteria
These criteria follow sub request logic\, which means that they are by default OR\-ed together\,
but will be AND\-ed together if you set required\=true.
You can also use exclude\=true to match on the negation of the query

    :param list attack: Restrict search to events matching these attack criteria.
These criteria follow sub request logic\, which means that they are by default OR\-ed together\,
but will be AND\-ed together if you set required\=true.
You can also use exclude\=true to match on the negation of the query

    :param list excludeFlag: Restrict search to events with NONE of these flags set
    :param list property: Restrict search to events with properties matching these criteria.
These criteria follow sub request logic\, which means that they are by default OR\-ed together\,
but will be AND\-ed together if you set required\=true.
You can also use exclude\=true to match on the negation of the query.

    :param list associatedCase: Restrict search to events associated to cases with these IDs.
NOTE\: Searching for ID 0 will return events that are not associated to any cases.

    :param list subCriteria: The set of sub criteria to add to the search
    :param str indexStartTimestamp: Only search in indexes after or on this day.
Defaults to current day.
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

Defaults to current day.
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details
