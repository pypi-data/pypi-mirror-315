    :param list type: Restrict search to of events of this type. If nothing is specified we will return all types
    :param str startTimestamp: Restrict search to data after this time.
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

    :param str endTimestamp: Restrict search to data before this time \(epoch millis\)
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

    :param list timeFieldStrategy: Which time fields to search for
    :param str timeMatchStrategy: Which time match strategy to use. Defaults to matching if any \(default any\)
    :param list severity: Which severities to search for
    :param list eventIdentifier: Which event identifiers to search for
    :param list customer: Which customers to search for events for. Search by id or short name
    :param bool productionCustomers: Restricts the search to customers that either are\, or are not in production.
If null we don\'t filter \(default\)
If true we only return production customers
If false\, we exclude all production customers

    :param list endpoint: Restrict search to events with endpoints matching these criteria
These criteria follow sub request logic\, which means that they are by default OR\-ed together\,
but will be AND\-ed together if you set required\=true.
You can also use exclude\=true to match on the negation of the query

    :param list attack: Restrict search to events matching these attack criteria.
These criteria follow sub request logic\, which means that they are by default OR\-ed together\,
but will be AND\-ed together if you set required\=true.
You can also use exclude\=true to match on the negation of the query

    :param list domain: Restrict search to events with one of these domains set
    :param list includeFlag: Restrict search to events with ALL of these flags set
    :param list excludeFlag: Restrict search to events with NONE of these flags set
    :param list property: Restrict search to events with properties matching these criteria.
These criteria follow sub request logic\, which means that they are by default OR\-ed together\,
but will be AND\-ed together if you set required\=true.
You can also use exclude\=true to match on the negation of the query.

    :param list associatedCase: Restrict search to events associated to cases with these IDs.
NOTE\: Searching for ID 0 will return events that are not associated to any cases.

    :param list subCriteria: The set of sub criteria to add to the search
    :param str indexStartTimestamp: Only search in indexes after or on this day.
Defaults to current day.
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

    :param str indexEndTimestamp: Only search in indexes before or on this day.
Defaults to current day.
Timestamps can be milliseconds since epoch\, ISO8601 timestamp\, or a string with a relative timestamp. See the general integration guide for more details

    :param list sortBy: Which field\(s\) by which to sort the results
    :param list includeProperties: Which properties to include \(if includeAllProperties\=false\).
    :param int limit: Limit the results to the specified amount. If set to 0 we will stream all results matching the query \(default 25\)
    :param int offset: Skip specified amount of results \(default 0\)
    :param bool includeAllProperties: Whether to include all properties \(overrides the selection of \'includeProperties\' if set to true\). \(default false\)
    :param bool includeComments: Whether to include comments. \(default false\)
    :param bool includeSubEvents: Whether to include sub\-events\' IDs \(only for aggregated events\). \(default false\)
    :param json: return the response's body as a ``dict`` parsed from json. ``True`` by
      default. If set to false, the raw ``requests.Response`` object will be returned.
    :param verify: path to a certificate bundle or boolean indicating whether SSL
      verification should be performed.
    :param apiKey: Argus API key.
    :param authentication: authentication override
    :param server_url: API base URL override
