# Features At A Glance:
- **Tagging**: Easily run specific job groups (e.g., lint, test, python).
- **Phases**: Organize tasks by phase (e.g., edit, test, deploy).
- **Configurable Options**: Customize how jobs are executed using simple options.
- **Declarative**: Jobs are define using simple YAML in [.runem.yml](https://lursight.github.io/runem/docs/configuration.html) .

# Using Run'em

## Installation

```bash
pip install runem
```

## Quick-start

## Basic quick-start
Create the following `.runem.yml` file at the root of your project:

```yml
- job:
    command: echo "hello world!"
```

Then anywhere in your project run `runem` to see how and when that task is run, and how long it took:
```bash
runem
```

To see the actual log output you will need to use `--verbose` as `runem` hides anything that isn't important. Only failures and reports are considered important.
```bash
# Or, to see "hello world!", use --verbose
runem --verbose  # add --verbose to see the actual output
```

To see how you can control your job use `--help`:
```bash
runem --help
```
