Welcome to the Multiplayer Games module in our repository. This directory houses a collection of multiplayer games, each designed to evaluate the collaborative and competitive capabilities of large language models (LLMs). These games require a range of skills, including strategic planning, negotiation, bluffing, and teamwork, making them ideal for assessing LLMs in multi-agent settings. Each game environment is implemented to be accessible, extendable, and adaptable for various interaction styles.
