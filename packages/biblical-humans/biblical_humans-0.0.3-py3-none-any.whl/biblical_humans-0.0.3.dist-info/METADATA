# Biblical Humans Library
a Python collection of biblical humans and their family relations

## Quickstart
the library provides different scopes of information

### Father Objects
a set of classes that represent biblical fathers from different nationalities. For example, Hebrew fathers: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as well as Mesopotamian fathers: Noah, Shem, and Ham.

```
from biblical_humans import hebrews
from biblical_humans import mesopotamians

abraham = hebrews.Abraham()
noah = mesopotamians.Noah()

print(abraham.__dict__)
print(noah.__dict__)
```
### List of Humans
on a broader scope, the library traces different categories of humans, such as fathers, mothers and children from different nationalities.

```
from biblical_humans import hebrews
from biblical_humans import mesopotamians

heb_mothers = hebrews.mothers
mes_children = mesopotamians.children

print(heb_mothers)
print(mes_children)
```
