# pyphotonics

PyPhotonics is a post-processing python code that calculates photonic properties of materials. Based on the outcome of DFT, constrained DFT and vibrational calculations using DFT performed using VASP for a defect system, PyPhotonics uses the results in the output files and calculates the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect and the photoluminescence line-shape. Soon, the code will calculate the carrier capture coefficient and carrier lifetimes for defects, which are essential quantities for assessing the photovoltaic efficiency of materials.

# Installation

You can install PyPhotonics using the pip command: `pip install pyphotonics`. The following python packages are required:

- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

# Directory structure

The `pyphotonics` module is composed of the following files:

```
/pyphotonics
    /__init__.py
    /constants.py: A list of physical constants.
    /photoluminescence.py: Contains the Photoluminescence class, which drives the photonics calculations.
```

# How to use

## PL line-shape and the Huang-Rhys factor

To calculate the PL line-shape and the Huang-Rhys of a crystal structure using pyphotonics, a number of DFT calculations should be performed with VASP first:
- The ground state structure of the crystal should be optimized. Let's call the output file CONTCAR_GS.
- The excited state structure of the crystal should be optimized. Let's call the output file CONTCAR_ES. For a tutorial on how to setup such calculation, see this [tutorial](./vasp_constrained_occupations.md)
- The phonon modes of the ground state system should be calculated with VASP, and the `bands.yaml` file should be produced using the `phonopy` code.

Once all of the above is done, you can calculate the HR factor and PL line-shape as follows (the complete example is in the `test/` directory):


```
from pyphotonics.photoluminescence import Photoluminescence
p = Photoluminescence("CONTCAR_GS", "CONTCAR_ES", 189, method="phonopy", resolution=1000)

```

You can also run `pyphotonics` from the command line by typing the following in the directory `test/photoluminscence/`:

```
pyphotonics -cgs CONTCAR_GS -ces CONTCAR_ES -m 189 -M phonopy -r 1000
```


## Setting up the INCAR for CDFT

VASP allows you to excite a crystal structure by constraining the occupations of the electronic bands. Let's say you want to excite a spin-up (spin component 1) or spin-down (spin component 2) electron from the ground state to the excited state. To do this, run the following command:

```
pyphotonics-incar <path to your OUTCAR file>
```


`pyphotonics` will write to the terminal the values of the two INCAR tags, `FERWE` and `FERDO`, which you can then copy-paste into your INCAR file to perform the excited state optimisation.

There is a sample `OUTCAR` file in the directory `test/ferwe_ferdo` which you can test with. Go to the directory and type: `pyphotonics-incar`.

### What are the `FERWE` and `FERDO`?

These are INCAR tags that specify the electronic occupation. Here is how you can construct those tags for any structure:

- Find out how many bands do you have. You can obtain that by search for `NBANDS` in the OUTCAR file
- Find out how many k points do you have. You can look that up in the OUTCAR by searching for the section that starts with the string spin component 1 in the OUTCAR. Let's call that number `N_K`.
- Find out how many electrons are occupying spin components 1 and 2 by searching the **last** such section in the OUTCAR that starts with spin component 1. Let's say there are `O_UP` electrons that occupy the spin up, `O_DN` electrons that occupy the spin down.
- Next, calculate how many states are empty in both spins: empty states in the spin up = `U_UP` where `U_UP = NBANDS - O_UP`. Same applies for `U_DN`.

Finally, add the `FERWE` (spin up, or spin component 1) and `FERDO` (spin down, or spin component 2) as follows:

- `FERWE = [O_UP-1]*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 [U_UP-1]*0.0 <repeated N_K times>`
- `FERDO = [O_DN]*1.0 [U_DN]*0.0 <repeated N_K times>`

Note the `<repeated N_K times>` above. It means: repeat `[O_UP-1]*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 [U_UP-1]*0.0` for `N_K` times.

Let's have an example. Let's say we have 8 kpoints in both spins, 216 bands, where the spin up electrons occupy 144 bands and the spin down occupy 142 bands. Then, here are the two tags:

- `FERWE = 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0 143*1.0 1*0.0 1*1.0 71*0.0`
- `FERDO = 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0 142*1.0 74*0.0`
