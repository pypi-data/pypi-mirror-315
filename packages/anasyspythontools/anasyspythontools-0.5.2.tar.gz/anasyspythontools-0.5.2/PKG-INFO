NOTE
-----

Please note that this package is currently beta. Things may break unexpectedly. Most functions writing to Analysis Studio format have been disabled so I don't see how this package could break your existing data anymore. 

Anasys Python Tools
===================

Anasys Python Tools is a python package for working with files generated by Anasys Instruments' (now Bruker) Analysis Studio software. Anasys Python Tools was originally developed by Cody Schindler from Anasys.


Basic Usage
-----------
.. code-block:: python

  import anasyspythontools as anasys
  # Read your Analysis Studio file
  f = anasys.read("afmdata.axz")
  # Grab all the height map data from the file
  heightmaps = f.HeightMaps
  # Show off your beautiful images
  heightmaps['Height 1'].show()
  # Unsure what the data looks like? Try:
  dir(f) # Displays user-accessible data
  dir(f.HeightMaps)
  
  
More useage information can be found in the `examples` folder.


Features
--------

- Read files with .axz, .axd, file extensions
- Extract AFM spectral and height map images as numpy arrays
- Export spectra and images to xarray type
- Quickly display and save your data
- Use your data with popular Python data libraries and applications (Pandas, Orange3, Jupyter, etc.)
- Work with your data when you're away from your instruments
- Evaluate your data in a trasparent and flexible way


Installation
------------

**From pip**

.. code-block:: bash
  
  pip install anasyspythontools

To my understanding the MIT license constitutes an "explicit permission" to redistribute and modify. To be on the safe side, I (GeorgRamer) have repeatedly, over a span of several years tried to get confirmation on that from Bruker. I never got a definite answer.
