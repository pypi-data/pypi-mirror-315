# Bluemath {**Toolkit**}

Module collection for custom climate data analysis. The main objective of this Python package is to provide a set of statistical tools tailored for climate data analysis, with a focus on statistical classification and prediction.

The package also includes a set of utility functions for processing climate data. To facilitate understanding of how to use these modules, simple demonstration scripts and the necessary data have been added to this repository.
