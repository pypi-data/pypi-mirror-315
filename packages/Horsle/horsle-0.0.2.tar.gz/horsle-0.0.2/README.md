# Horsle
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/JKiran4/Horse-Race-Simulator.svg?token=puGRmUsVeyZRKzqBrQKR&branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/JKiran4/Horse-Race-Simulator)

Note that the coverage for betting is very low as it relies on all of the other modules to function - to make it sure it has coverage it would require us to overhaul our current test suite

Required libraries: turtle, time, pandas, random, datetime

Executing the test file should run the whole program. Make sure runs.csv is in the downlaoded package.

Note that the race will only run once, but for added functionality, we may change the simulation library (turtle) so we can run games repeatedly without closing the program. Also, note that Macs have issues with the turtle library displaying the race, but it should still execute the program.
