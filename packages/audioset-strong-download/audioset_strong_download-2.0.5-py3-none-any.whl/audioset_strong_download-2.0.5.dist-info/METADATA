# AudioSet Strong Download

This repository contains code for downloading the [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/) dataset.
The code is provided as-is, and is not officially supported by Google.
Please note that as YouTube continually updates its API, the code in this repository may become outdated and stop working in the future.

## Updates in This Repository
This repository is a revised version of [audioset-download](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/audioset-download), with the following major updates:

1. Updated commands to support the latest version of `yt-dlp`, with a particular focus on specifying the time segment to be downloaded.
2. Added functionality to download either the dataset with [original 10-second-resolution labels](https://research.google.com/audioset/download.html) or the [2021 temporally-strong labels](https://research.google.com/audioset/download_strong.html).
3. Enabled support for incorporating `cookies` in the `yt-dlp` command. 

## Requirements

* Python 3.9 (it may work with other versions, but it has not been tested)

## Installation

```bash
# Install ffmpeg
brew install ffmpeg
# Install audioset-strong-download
pip install audioset-strong-download
```

## Usage

The following code snippet downloads the unbalanced train set, and stores it in the `test` directory.
It only downloads the files associated with the `Speech` and `Cart` labels, and uses two parallel processes for downloading.
If a file is associated to multiple labels, it will be stored only once, and associated to the first label in the list.

```python
from audioset_strong_download import Downloader
d = Downloader(root_path='test', labels=["Speech", "Cart"], n_jobs=2, download_type='eval', dataset_ver='strong', copy_and_replicate=False)
d.download(format = 'wav')
```

## Implementation

The main class is `audioset_strong_download.Downloader`. It is initialized using the following parameters:
* `root_path`: the path to the directory where the dataset will be downloaded.
* `labels`: a list of labels to download. If `None`, all labels will be downloaded. See [weak labels](http://storage.googleapis.com/us_audioset/youtube_corpus/v1/csv/class_labels_indices.csv) and [strong labels](http://storage.googleapis.com/us_audioset/youtube_corpus/strong/mid_to_display_name.tsv)
* `n_jobs`: the number of parallel downloads. Default is 1.
* `dataset_ver`:
  * `strong`: [temporally-strong labels (May 2021)](https://research.google.com/audioset/download_strong.html)
  * `weak`: [original 10-second-resolution labels](https://research.google.com/audioset/download.html)
* `download_type`: the type of download. It can be one of the following:
  * `balanced_train`: balanced train set (weak)
  * `unbalanced_train`: unbalanced train set (weak)
  * `train`: train set (strong)
  * `eval`: evaluation set (weak & strong)
* `cookies`: /path/to/cookies/file.txt (default: None) 
* `copy_and_replicate`: if `True` if a file is associated to multiple labels, it will be copied and replicated for each label. If `False`, it will be associated to the first label in the list. Default is `True`.

The methods of the class are:
* `download(format='vorbis', quality=5)`: downloads the dataset. 
* The format can be one of the following (supported by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#post-processing-options) `--audio-format` parameter):
    * `vorbis`: downloads the dataset in Ogg Vorbis format. This is the default.
    * `wav`: downloads the dataset in WAV format.
    * `mp3`: downloads the dataset in MP3 format.
    * `m4a`: downloads the dataset in M4A format.
    * `flac`: downloads the dataset in FLAC format.
    * `opus`: downloads the dataset in Opus format.
    * `webm`: downloads the dataset in WebM format.
    * ... and many more.
  * The quality can be an integer between 0 and 10. Default is 5.
* `read_class_mapping()`: reads the class mapping file. It is not used externally.
* `download_file(...)`: downloads a single file. It is not used externally.

## Cookies

Due to the large number of files in AudioSet, YouTube may block the program from accessing videos. To address this issue, you can pass cookies to `yt-dlp` with the following steps:
1. Run the command:  
   ```bash
   yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome --cookies cookies.txt
   ```  
   This will generate a `cookies.txt` file in your current directory.

2. Specify the cookies file path in the `Downloader()` function:  
   ```python
   cookies = "/path/to/cookies/file.txt"
   ```

For more details, refer to the [yt-dlp FAQ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp).
