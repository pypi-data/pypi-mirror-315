# RAVA Python Diagnostics

The RAVA Diagnostics app introduces a test suite designed to evaluate the 
statistical properties of randomness produced by the RAVA circuit. It comprises 
three distinct sub-applications:

* Quick Tests: Conducted on relatively small samples generated in real-time 
  to detect significant errors within the RAVA circuit.

* Acquisition: Generation of large files comprising pulse counts, bytes, or 
  numbers extracted from an RAVA device. (This sub-app is imported from the
  [RAVA Python Driver](https://github.com/gabrielguerrer/rng_rava_driver_py) 
  package).

* Detailed Tests: Analyzes the statistical distribution of bias and correlation 
  metrics associated with the random bytes obtained through the Acquisition 
  module. Moreover, it explores the normality of pulse count distributions 
  across different sampling intervals. Additionally, it implements a 
  visualization of the reports generated by the 
  [NIST Tests](https://csrc.nist.rip/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software), 
  offering an insightful representation of its results.
  Lastly, a reporting feature generates a PDF file summarizing the information 
  from the Detailed Tests. This document is designed to facilitate the quality 
  assessment of a specific instance of the RAVA circuit.
  
The Diagnostics suite is an open-source implementation of the tests outlined in 
the article presenting the RAVA circuit. For more details, refer to
[IEEE Access, DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3327325](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295491).
