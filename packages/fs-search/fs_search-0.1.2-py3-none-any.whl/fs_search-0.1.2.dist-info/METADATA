# fs-search

`fs-search` is a command-line tool that allows you to search for files and directories within a specified base path. You can customize your search by including or excluding specific file extensions and directories, and the results can be displayed in a user-friendly format with options to save them to a file.

## Features

- Search for files and directories starting from a specified base path.
- Exclude files based on extensions (`-e`).
- Exclude directories from the search (`-E`).
- Search only for files (`-f`) or only for directories (`-d`).
- Save the results to a file (`-o`).
- Display relative paths instead of full paths (`-r`).
- Supports cross-platform usage with `pathlib`.
- Colorful output using `colorama`.
- Easily extendable for future features.
