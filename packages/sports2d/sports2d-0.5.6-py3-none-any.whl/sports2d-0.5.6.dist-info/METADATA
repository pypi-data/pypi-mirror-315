# Sports2D

**`Sports2D` automatically computes 2D joint positions, as well as joint and segment angles from a video or a webcam.**

</br>

> **`Announcement:`\
> Complete rewriting of the code!** Run `pip install sports2d -U` to get the latest version.
> - Faster, more accurate
> - Works from a webcam
> - Results in meters rather than pixels. **New in v0.5!**
> - Better visualization output 
> - More flexible, easier to run
> - Batch process multiple videos at once
> 
> Note: Colab version broken for now. I'll fix it in the next few weeks.
<!--User-friendly Colab version released! (and latest issues fixed, too)\
Works on any smartphone!**\
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://bit.ly/Sports2D_Colab)-->

`Warning:` Angle estimation is only as good as the pose estimation algorithm, i.e., it is not perfect.\
`Warning:` Results are acceptable only if the persons move in the 2D plane (sagittal or frontal plane). The persons need to be filmed as parallel as possible to the motion plane.\
If you need 3D research-grade markerless joint kinematics, consider using several cameras, and constraining angles to a biomechanically accurate model. See **[Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim)** for example.

<!--`Warning:` Google Colab does not follow the European GDPR requirements regarding data privacy. [Install locally](#installation) if this matters.-->

<!--`Know issue`: Results won't be good with some iPhone videos in portrait mode (unless you are working on Colab). This is solved by priorly converting them with `ffmpeg -i video_input.mov video_output.mp4`, or even more simply with any random online video converter such as https://video-converter.com.-->

## Installation and Demonstration

### Installation

<!--- OPTION 0: **Use Colab** \
  User-friendly (but full) version, also works on a phone or a tablet.\
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://bit.ly/Sports2D_Colab)\
  YouTube tutorial:\
  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5RpcJ8o1Y"><img src="Content/Video_tuto_Sports2D_Colab.png" width="380"></a>
  
-->

- OPTION 1: **Quick install** \
    Open a terminal. Type `python -V` to make sure python >=3.8 <=3.11 is installed. If not, install it [from there](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Run:
    ``` cmd
    pip install sports2d
    ```

- OPTION 2: **Safer install with Anaconda**\
    Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):\
    Open an Anaconda prompt and create a virtual environment by typing:
    ``` cmd
    conda create -n Sports2D python=3.9 -y
    conda activate Sports2D
    pip install sports2d
    ```

- OPTION 3: **Build from source and test the last changes**\
     Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and clone the Sports2D repository.
     ``` cmd
     git clone https://github.com/davidpagnon/sports2d.git
     cd sports2d
     pip install .
     ```

<br>

### Demonstration

Just open a command line and run:
``` cmd
sports2d
```

You should see the joint positions and angles being displayed in real time.

Check the folder where you run that command line to find the resulting `video`, `images`, `TRC pose` and `MOT angle` files (which can be opened with any spreadsheet software), and `logs`.

***Important:*** If you ran the conda install, you first need to activate the environment: run `conda activate sports2d` in the Anaconda prompt.

<img src="Content/Demo_terminal.png" width="760">

***Note:***\
The Demo video is voluntarily challenging to demonstrate the robustness of the process after sorting, interpolation and filtering. It contains:
- One person walking in the sagittal plane
- One person doing jumping jacks in the frontal plane. This person then performs a flip while being backlit, both of which are challenging for the pose detection algorithm
- One tiny person flickering in the background who needs to be ignored

<br>

### Play with the parameters

For a full list of the available parameters, check the [Config_Demo.toml](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D/blob/main/Sports2D/Demo/Config_demo.toml) file or type:
``` cmd
sports2d --help
```
<br>

#### Run on custom video with default parameters:
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --video_input path_to_video.mp4
  ```

#### Run on webcam with default parameters: 
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --video_input webcam
  ```
<br>

#### Get coordinates in meters rather than in pixels: 

<!-- You either need to provide a calibration file, or simply the height of a person (Note that the latter will not take distortions into account, and that it will be less accurate for motion in the frontal plane).\-->
Just provide the height of the analyzed person (and their ID in case of multiple person detection).\
The floor angle and the origin of the xy axis are computed automatically from gait. If you analyze another type of motion, you can manually specify them.\
Note that it does not take distortions into account, and that it will be less accurate for motions in the frontal plane.

  ``` cmd
  sports2d --to_meters True --calib_file calib_demo.toml
  ```
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --to_meters True --person_height 1.65 --calib_on_person_id 2
  ```
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --to_meters True --person_height 1.65 --calib_on_person_id 2 --floor_angle 0 --xy_origin 0 940
  ```
<br>

#### Run with custom parameters (all non specified are set to default): 
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --video_input demo.mp4 other_video.mp4
  ```
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --show_graphs False --time_range 1.2 2.7 --result_dir path_to_result_dir --slowmo_factor 4
  ```
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --multiperson false --mode lightweight --det_frequency 50 
  ```
<br>

#### Run with a toml configuration file: 
  ``` cmd
  sports2d --config Config_demo.toml
  ```
<br>

#### Run within a Python script: 
  ``` python
  from Sports2D import Sports2D; Sports2D.process('Config_demo.toml')
  ```
  ``` python
  from Sports2D import Sports2D; Sports2D.process(config_dict)
  ```

<br>

## Go further

### Too slow for you?

**Quick fixes:**
- Use ` --save_vid false --save_img false --show_realtime_results false`: Will not save images or videos, and will not display the results in real time. 
- Use `--mode lightweight`: Will use a lighter version of RTMPose, which is faster but less accurate.
- Use `--det_frequency 50`: Will detect poses only every 50 frames, and track keypoints in between, which is faster.
- Use `--multiperson false`: Can be used if one single person is present in the video. Otherwise, persons' IDs may be mixed up.
- Use `--load_trc <path_to_file_px.trc>`: Will use pose estimation results from a file. Useful if you want to use different parameters for pixel to meter conversion or angle calculation without running detection and pose estimation all over.

<br> 

**Use your GPU**:\
Will be much faster, with no impact on accuracy. However, the installation takes about 6 GB of additional storage space.

1. Run `nvidia-smi` in a terminal. If this results in an error, your GPU is probably not compatible with CUDA. If not, note the "CUDA version": it is the latest version your driver is compatible with (more information [on this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60987997/why-torch-cuda-is-available-returns-false-even-after-installing-pytorch-with)).

   Then go to the [ONNXruntime requirement page](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements), note the latest compatible CUDA and cuDNN requirements. Next, go to the [pyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and install the latest version that satisfies these requirements (beware that torch 2.4 ships with cuDNN 9, while torch 2.3 installs cuDNN 8). For example:
   ``` cmd
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
   ```

<!-- > ***Note:*** Issues were reported with the default command. However, this has been tested and works:
`pip install torch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118` -->

2. Finally, install ONNX Runtime with GPU support:
   ```
   pip install onnxruntime-gpu
   ```

3. Check that everything went well within Python with these commands:
   ``` bash
   python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
   python -c 'import onnxruntime as ort; print(ort.get_available_providers())'
   # Should print "True ['CUDAExecutionProvider', ...]"
   ```
   <!-- print(f'torch version: {torch.__version__}, cuda version: {torch.version.cuda}, cudnn version: {torch.backends.cudnn.version()}, onnxruntime version: {ort.__version__}') -->

<br>

### What you need is what you get

#### Analyze a fraction of your video:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --time_range 1.2 2.7
  ```
<br>

#### Customize your output:
- Choose whether you want video, images, trc pose file, angle mot file, and real-time display:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --save_vid false --save_img true --save_pose false --save_angles true --show_realtime_results false
  ```
- Choose which angles you need:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --joint_angles 'right knee' 'left knee' --segment_angles None
  ```
- Choose where to display the angles: either as a list on the upper-left of the image, or near the joint/segment, or both:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --display_angle_values_on body
  ```
- You can also decide not to calculate and display angles at all:
  ```cmd
  sports2d --calculate_angles false
  ```
<br>

#### Run on several videos at once:
You can individualize (or not) the parameters.
  ```cmd
  sports2d --video_input demo.mp4 other_video.mp4 --time_range 1.2 2.7
  ```
  ```cmd
  sports2d --video_input demo.mp4 other_video.mp4 --time_range 1.2 2.7 0 3.5
  ```

<!--
<br>

### Constrain results to a biomechanical model

> Why + image\
> Add explanation in "how it works" section

#### Installation
You will need to install OpenSim via conda, which makes installation slightly more complicated.

1. **Install Anaconda or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).**

   Once installed, open an Anaconda prompt and create a virtual environment:
   ```
   conda create -n Sports2D python=3.9 -y 
   conda activate Sports2D
   ```

2. **Install OpenSim**:\
Install the OpenSim Python API (if you do not want to install via conda, refer [to this page](https://opensimconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenSim/pages/53085346/Scripting+in+Python#ScriptinginPython-SettingupyourPythonscriptingenvironment(ifnotusingconda))):
   ```
   conda install -c opensim-org opensim -y
   ```
   
3. **Install Sports2D**:\
Open a terminal. 
    ``` cmd
    pip install sports2d
    ```
<br>

#### Usage

Need person doing a 2D motion. If not, trim the video with `--time_range` option.

```cmd
sports2d --time_range 1.2 2.7 --ik true --person_orientation front none left
```

<br>

#### Visualize the results
- The simplest option is to use OpenSim GUI
- If you want to see the skeleton overlay on the video, you can install the Pose2Sim Blender plugin.

### How it works

Sports2D:
- Detects 2D joint centers from a video or a webcam with RTMLib.
- Converts pixel coordinates to meters.
- Optionally computes selected joint and segment angles. 
- Optionally saves processed image files and video file. Optionally saves processed poses as a TRC file, and angles as a MOT file (OpenSim compatible).

<br>

**Okay but how does it work, really?**\
Sports2D:

1. **Reads stream from a webcam, from one video, or from a list of videos**. Selects the specified time range to process.

2. **Sets up pose estimation with RTMLib.** It can be run in lightweight, balanced, or performance mode, and for faster inference, keypoints can be tracked instead of detected for a certain number of frames. Any RTMPose model can be used. 

3. **Tracks people** so that their IDs are consistent across frames. A person is associated to another in the next frame when they are at a small distance. IDs remain consistent even if the person disappears from a few frames. This carefully crafted `sports2d` tracker runs at a comparable speed as the RTMlib one but is much more robust. The user can still choose the RTMLib method if they need it by specifying it in the Config.toml file.

4. **Chooses the right persons to keep.** In single-person mode, only keeps the person with the highest average scores over the sequence. In multi-person mode, only retrieves the keypoints with high enough confidence, and only keeps the persons with high enough average confidence over each frame.

4. **Converts the pixel coordinates to meters.** The user can provide a calibration file, or simply the size of a specified person. The floor angle and the coordinate origin can either be detected automatically from the gait sequence, or be manually specified.

5. **Computes the selected joint and segment angles**, and flips them on the left/right side if the respective foot is pointing to the left/right. 

5. **Draws the results on the image:**\
  Draws bounding boxes around each person and writes their IDs\
  Draws the skeleton and the keypoints, with a green to red color scale to account for their confidence\
  Draws joint and segment angles on the body, and writes the values either near the joint/segment, or on the upper-left of the image with a progress bar

6. **Interpolates and filters results:** Missing pose and angle sequences are interpolated unless gaps are too large. Results are filtered according to the selected filter (among `Butterworth`, `Gaussian`, `LOESS`, or `Median`) and their parameters

7. **Optionally show** processed images, saves them, or saves them as a video\
  **Optionally plots** pose and angle data before and after processing for comparison\
  **Optionally saves** poses for each person as a TRC file in pixels and meters, angles as a MOT file, and calibration data as a [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim) TOML file 

<br>

**Joint angle conventions:**
- Ankle dorsiflexion: Between heel and big toe, and ankle and knee.\
  *-90° when the foot is aligned with the shank.*
- Knee flexion: Between hip, knee, and ankle.\
  *0° when the shank is aligned with the thigh.*
- Hip flexion: Between knee, hip, and shoulder.\
  *0° when the trunk is aligned with the thigh.* 
- Shoulder flexion: Between hip, shoulder, and elbow.\
  *180° when the arm is aligned with the trunk.*
- Elbow flexion: Between wrist, elbow, and shoulder.\
  *0° when the forearm is aligned with the arm.*

**Segment angle conventions:**\
Angles are measured anticlockwise between the horizontal and the segment.
- Foot: Between heel and big toe
- Shank: Between ankle and knee
- Thigh: Between hip and knee
- Pelvis: Between left and right hip
- Trunk: Between hip midpoint and shoulder midpoint
- Shoulders: Between left and right shoulder
- Head: Between neck and top of the head
- Arm: Between shoulder and elbow
- Forearm: Between elbow and wrist

### How to contribute
I would happily welcome any proposal for new features, code improvement, and more!\
If you want to contribute to Sports2D, please follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) on how to fork, modify and push code, and submit a pull request. I would appreciate it if you provided as much useful information as possible about how you modified the code, and a rationale for why you're making this pull request. Please also specify on which operating system and on which python version you have tested the code.

*Here is a to-do list: feel free to complete it:*
- [x] Compute **segment angles**.
- [x] **Multi-person** detection, consistent over time.
- [x] **Only interpolate small gaps**.
- [x] **Filtering and plotting tools**.
- [x] Handle sudden **changes of direction**.
- [x] **Batch processing** for the analysis of multiple videos at once.
- [x] Option to only save one person (with the highest average score, or with the most frames and fastest speed)
- [x] Run again without pose estimation with the option `--load_trc` for px .trc file.
- [x] **Convert positions to meters** by providing the person height, a calibration file, or 3D points [to click on the image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74248955/how-to-display-the-coordinates-of-the-points-clicked-on-the-image-in-google-cola)
- [ ] Perform **Inverse kinematics and dynamics** with OpenSim (cf. [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim), but in 2D). Update [this model](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D/blob/main/Sports2D/Utilities/2D_gait.osim) (add arms, markers, remove muscles and contact spheres). Add pipeline example.
- [ ] Run with the option `--compare_to` to visually compare motion with a trc file. If run with a webcam input, the user can follow the motion of the trc file. Further calculation can then be done to compare specific variables.
- [ ] **Colab version**: more user-friendly, usable on a smartphone.
- [ ] **GUI applications** for Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as for Android and iOS.

</br>

- [ ] **Track other points and angles** with classic tracking methods (cf. [Kinovea](https://www.kinovea.org/features.html)), or by training a model (cf. [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html)).
- [ ] **Pose refinement**. Click and move badly estimated 2D points. See [DeepLabCut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEuBKB7eqmk) for inspiration.
- [ ] Add tools for annotating images, undistort them, take perspective into account, etc. (cf. [Kinovea](https://www.kinovea.org/features.html)).
