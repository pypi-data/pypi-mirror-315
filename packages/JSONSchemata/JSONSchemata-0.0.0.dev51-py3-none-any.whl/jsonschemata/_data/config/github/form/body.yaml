title: GitHub Form Body
description: |
  Definition of the elements in a GitHub form, according to GitHub's
  [syntax for GitHub's form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema),
  which is shared between issue forms and discussion category forms.
  
  Each form must have a body, defined as an array of form elements for requesting user input.
  Each form element itself is defined as a set of key-value pairs
  that determine the type of the element, the properties of the element,
  and the constraints you want to apply to the element.
