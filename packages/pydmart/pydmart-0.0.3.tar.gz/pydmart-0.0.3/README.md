## Installation

Pydmart is distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pydmart/):

```

## Example

Just simple steps and you will be ready to interact with your Dmart instance

1. import the class `from pydmart.dmart_service import DmartService`
2. instantiate an object `d_client = DmartService({dmart_instance_url}, {username}, {password})`
3. Create / delete connection pool : Preferably in global fastapi lifespan (async)
