0.5.0 (2024-12-13)

* Fixed an issue (#27) whereby empty strings would not be part of the string literal
  inferred from a string-based field's ``options`` when using a Django field ref.
* Added a generic configuration step for the Django sites module.
* Slug fields are now explicitly validated in Django field refs.

💥 **NOTE**: This release contains a number of significantly breaking changes. 💥

  configuration models, and to rely solely on an ``execute`` hook, with ``is_configured``
  and ``test_results`` being deprecated. Details of the new API can be found in the
  README.
* The ``generate_config_docs`` command has been disabled until it can amended to work
  with the new API, which is planned for an upcoming release.

* ``generate_config_docs`` management command added to autogenerate documentation based on configurationsteps
