# **Altikrity**

**Altikrity** is a Python library designed for multi-layer encryption. It allows you to securely encrypt your code and data using a special method, ensuring they remain safe and protected. The library provides functions for encrypting text and running encrypted code seamlessly.

## **Features**
- Multi-layer encryption ensuring robust security.
- Secure execution of encrypted code without the need to decrypt it.
- Simple and easy-to-use API for encrypting text and running encrypted code.
- Ideal for developers who need to protect sensitive code and data.

## **Installation**

You can install **Altikrity** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install altikrity
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Encrypting Text**

Use the `encrypt_text` function to encrypt plain text in a secure manner.

```python
from altikrity import encrypt_text

text = "Hello, this is a secret message"
encrypted_text = encrypt_text(text)
print(encrypted_text)
```

### **2. Running Encrypted Code**

You can run encrypted code directly without decrypting it.

```python
from altikrity import run_encrypted_code

encrypted_code = "your_encrypted_code_here"
run_encrypted_code(encrypted_code)
```

## **Examples**

Here are some common examples of how to use the library:

### **Example 1: Encrypt text**

```python
text = "This is a test message."
encrypted = encrypt_text(text)
print("Encrypted Text:", encrypted)
```

### **Example 2: Encrypt and run code**

```python
encrypted_code = "your_encrypted_python_code_here"
run_encrypted_code(encrypted_code)
```

## **About the Developer**

**Altikrity** was developed by **Abdullah Al-Tikriti**, a passionate programmer from Iraq. At the age of 14, Abdullah created this library to provide secure encryption solutions for developers and to help protect sensitive data.
