## Overview

This MCP server enables secure command-line execution with robust security measures including command whitelisting, path
validation, and
execution controls. Perfect for providing controlled CLI access to LLM applications while maintaining security.

## Features

- 🔒 Secure command execution with strict validation
- ⚙️ Configurable command and flag whitelisting
- 🛡️ Path traversal prevention
- 🚫 Shell operator injection protection
- ⏱️ Execution timeouts and length limits
- 📝 Detailed error reporting
- 🔄 Async operation support

## Configuration

Configure the server using environment variables:

| Variable             | Description                              | Default            |
 |----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `ALLOWED_DIR`        | Base directory for command execution     | Required           |
| `ALLOWED_COMMANDS`   | Comma-separated list of allowed commands | `ls,cat,pwd`       |
| `ALLOWED_FLAGS`      | Comma-separated list of allowed flags    | `-l,-a,--help`     |
| `MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH` | Maximum command string length            | `1024`             |
| `COMMAND_TIMEOUT`    | Command execution timeout (seconds)      | `30`               |

## Installation

To install CLI MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/protocol/cli-mcp-server):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install cli-mcp-server --client claude
```

## Available Tools

### run_command

Executes whitelisted CLI commands within allowed directories.

**Input Schema:**

 ```json
 {
  "command": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Command to execute (e.g., 'ls -l' or 'cat file.txt')"
  }
}
 ```

### show_security_rules

Displays current security configuration and restrictions.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

> Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration

 ```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cli-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path/to/the/repo>/cli-mcp-server",
        "run",
        "cli-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_DIR": "</your/desired/dir>",
        "ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "ls,cat,pwd,echo",
        "ALLOWED_FLAGS": "-l,-a,--help,--version",
        "MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH": "1024",
        "COMMAND_TIMEOUT": "30"
      }
    }
  }
}
 ```

> Published Servers Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cli-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "cli-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_DIR": "</your/desired/dir>",
        "ALLOWED_COMMANDS": "ls,cat,pwd,echo",
        "ALLOWED_FLAGS": "-l,-a,--help,--version",
        "MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH": "1024",
        "COMMAND_TIMEOUT": "30"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
> In case it's not working or showing in the UI, clear your cache via `uv clean`.

## Security Features

- ✅ Command whitelist enforcement
- ✅ Flag validation
- ✅ Path traversal prevention
- ✅ Shell operator blocking
- ✅ Command length limits
- ✅ Execution timeouts
- ✅ Working directory restrictions

## Error Handling

The server provides detailed error messages for:

- Security violations
- Command timeouts
- Invalid command formats
- Path security violations
- Execution failures

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- MCP protocol library

## Development

### Building and Publishing

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

2. Build package distributions:
    ```bash
    uv build
    ```

   > This will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.

3. Publish to PyPI:
   ```bash
   uv publish --token {{YOUR_PYPI_API_TOKEN}}
   ```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with
this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory {{your source code local directory}}/cli-mcp-server run cli-mcp-server
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.
