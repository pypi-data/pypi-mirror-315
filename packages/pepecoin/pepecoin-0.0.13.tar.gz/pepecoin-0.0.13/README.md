Pepecoin(â‚±) Python Client 
</h1>

Pepecoin Python Client is a python client library for easily interacting with a Pepecoin node (via RPC) and developing cool applications.

If you want to check out a "Pepecoin Payment Gateway" example, check out this link: [Pepecoin FastAPI Payment Gateway](https://github.com/karaposu/pepecoin-fastapi-payment-gateway).

The `Pepecoin` class provides a simplified interface for wallet management, address generation, balance checking, payment verification, node connection checking, wallet locking/unlocking, and mass transferring funds.

---

## Features

- **Simplified RPC Connection**: Easily connect to a Pepecoin node using RPC.
- **Wallet Management**: Create, encrypt, lock, and unlock wallets.
- **Address Generation**: Generate new Pepecoin addresses with optional labels.
- **Balance Checking**: Check the balance of wallets.
- **Payment Verification**: Verify if payments have been received at specific addresses.
- **Mass Transfer**: Transfer funds from multiple wallets to a single address.
- **Node Connection Checking**: Verify if the Pepecoin node is connected and reachable.

---

## Installation

Install the package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pepecoin

# to install latest unstable version:
# pip install -e git+https://github.com/karaposu/pepecoin.git#egg=pepecoin
```


---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Automatic Setup**: If you haven't gone through the official pepecoin node setup process, you can run the following command  (comes bundled with "pip install pepecoin" ) to start the installation automatically:

  ```bash
  pepecoin-setup
  
  # for MacOS do:
  # pepecoin-setup-macos
  # beware that this will install many dependencies and build pepecoin binaries
  ```

  This command will execute a bash script included in the Pepecoin package that follows the steps in the official [Pepecoin installation documentation](https://github.com/pepecoinppc/pepecoin/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Feel free to inspect the script before running it.
it does these steps:  
      1. Prompts you for rpc_user and rpc_password you wanna use. 
      2. Download compiled binaries
      3. Create pepecoin.conf
      4. Add Pepecoin binaries to PATH
      5. Start Pepecoin daemon
      6. verify the daemon is indeed running 

- **Running Pepecoin Node**: You must have a Pepecoin node running with RPC enabled (you can start it by running `pepecoind -daemon` from the terminal).

- **RPC Credentials**: Don't forget to add `RPC_USER` and `RPC_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.

- It is important that you validate all is okay before moving forward. 
Run `pepecoin-cli getblockchaininfo`  and if you dont see a json output go to installation_troubleshooting.md

## Understanding the Limitations

Pepecoin's Core Version: Pepecoin is based on an older version of Bitcoin Core (likely around 0.10.x), which does not support the createwallet RPC method or multi-wallet functionality introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.17.0.
Single Wallet System: In this version, the node operates with a single wallet (wallet.dat) located in the data directory. There is no native support for managing multiple wallets via RPC calls.
Although accounts are deprecated in later versions of Bitcoin Core, they are available in the version Pepecoin is based on. Accounts allow you to partition your wallet into multiple logical sections, effectively simulating multiple wallets.
How Accounts Work
Separate Balances: Each account maintains its own balance, separate from other accounts.
Address Management: You can generate addresses associated with specific accounts.
Transaction Tracking: Transactions can be attributed to specific accounts.
All accounts share the same underlying wallet file. There is no way to encrypt accounts individually via RPC. Wallet-level encryption affects all accounts.




## Usage Examples

### Initialize the Pepecoin Client

```python
from pepecoin import Pepecoin
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

# Initialize the Pepecoin client
pepecoin = Pepecoin(
    rpc_user=os.environ.get("RPC_USER"),
    rpc_password=os.environ.get("RPC_PASSWORD"),
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=29373,
    wallet_name="merchant_wallet"
)
```

### Check Node Connection

```
if pepecoin.check_node_connection():
    print("Node is connected.")
else:
    print("Node is not connected.")
```

### Create a New Wallet

```
wallet_created = pepecoin.create_new_wallet(
    wallet_name="merchant_wallet",
    passphrase="secure_passphrase"
)
if wallet_created:
    print("Wallet created successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to create wallet.")
```

### Generate a New Address

```
payment_address = pepecoin.generate_new_address(label="order_12345")
print(f"Payment Address: {payment_address}")
```

### Check Wallet Balance

```
balance = pepecoin.check_balance()
print(f"Wallet Balance: {balance} PEPE")
```

### Check for Payments

```
payment_received = pepecoin.check_payment(
    address=payment_address,
    expected_amount=10.0
)
if payment_received:
    print("Payment received.")
else:
    print("Payment not yet received.")
```

### Lock and Unlock Wallet

```
# Unlock the wallet
pepecoin.unlock_wallet(
    wallet_name="merchant_wallet",
    passphrase="secure_passphrase",
    timeout=60  # Unlock for 60 seconds
)

# Lock the wallet
pepecoin.lock_wallet(wallet_name="merchant_wallet")
```

### Mass Transfer Funds

```
from_wallets = ["wallet1", "wallet2"]
passphrases = ["passphrase1", "passphrase2"]
to_address = "PMainWalletAddress1234567890"

tx_ids = pepecoin.mass_transfer(
    from_wallets=from_wallets,
    to_address=to_address,
    passphrases=passphrases
)
print(f"Mass transfer transaction IDs: {tx_ids}")
```

# Future Improvements 

- Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: The AuthServiceProxy class is synchronous. If we need asynchronous support, we might need to use an asynchronous RPC client or run synchronous code in a thread pool.

---

## Security Considerations

- **Passphrases**: Never hardcode passphrases in your code. Use secure methods to store and retrieve them (e.g., environment variables, secure key management systems).
- **RPC Credentials**: Protect your RPC credentials. Do not expose them in logs or version control.
- **Wallet Encryption**: Always encrypt wallets that hold real funds.
- **Node Security**: Ensure your Pepecoin node is secure, with proper firewall settings and access controls.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Consider using SSL/TLS for RPC communications.
