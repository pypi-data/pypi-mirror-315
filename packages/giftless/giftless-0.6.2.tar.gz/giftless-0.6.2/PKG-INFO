Giftless - a Pluggable Git LFS Server

Giftless is a Python implementation of a [Git LFS][1] Server. It is designed
with flexibility in mind, to allow pluggable storage backends, transfer
methods and authentication methods.

Giftless supports the *basic* Git LFS transfer mode with the following
storage backends:

* Local storage
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
* [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)
  with direct-to-cloud or streamed transfers
* [Amazon S3 Storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

In addition, Giftless implements a custom transfer mode called `multipart-basic`,
which is designed to take advantage of many vendors' multipart upload
capabilities. It requires a specialized Git LFS client to use, and is currently
not supported by standard Git LFS.

See the [giftless-client](https://github.com/datopian/giftless-client) project
for a compatible Python Git LFS client.

Additional transfer modes and storage backends could easily be added and
configured.
