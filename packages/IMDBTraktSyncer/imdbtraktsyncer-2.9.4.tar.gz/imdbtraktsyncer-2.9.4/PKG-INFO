# IMDB-Trakt-Syncer
This Python script syncs user watchlist, ratings and reviews for Movies, TV Shows and Episodes both ways between [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) and [IMDB](https://imdb.com/). Existing items will not be overwritten. Ratings, watchlist and comment/review sync are all optional. The user will be prompted to enter their settings and credentials on first run.

The script is compatible with operating systems that support Python (v3.6 or later) and Chromedriver (Windows, Linux and Mac). If you're interested in syncing ratings between Trakt, Plex, IMDB, and TMDB, I recommend the following projects: [PlexTraktSync](https://github.com/Taxel/PlexTraktSync), [IMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer), and [TMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/TMDB-Trakt-Syncer). See below for my other [recommended projects](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer?tab=readme-ov-file#other-recommended-projects).

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.6 or later) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). During Python installation, tick the box for adding Python to your PATH variable. _If these are already installed, you can skip this step. Please note this script does not affect Chrome in anyway, it is simply required in order for chromedriver to work._
2. Install the script by executing `python -m pip install IMDBTraktSyncer` in command line.
3. Login to [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and create a new API application named `IMDBTraktSyncer`. In the "Redirect uri" field, enter `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`, then save the application.
4. Run the script by executing `IMDBTraktSyncer` in the command line.
5. Follow the prompts during the first run. You will need to enter your Trakt `client ID` and `client secret` from step 3, as well as your IMDB `username` and `password`. Please note that these details are saved insecurely as `credentials.txt` in the same folder as the script. It is recommended to change your IMDB password to something unique beforehand.
6. Setup is complete. The script will continue running and syncing your ratings. You can monitor its progress in the command line. See below for [setting up automation](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer?tab=readme-ov-file#for-setting-up-automation-see-the-following-wiki-pages).

_Replace `VERSION_NUMBER` with your [desired version](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer/releases) (e.g. 1.1.6) and run in your operating system's native command line._

## Alternative Manual Installation Method (without pip install)
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.6 or later) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). During Python installation, tick the box for adding Python to your PATH variable.  _If these are already installed, you can skip this step. Please note this script does not affect Chrome in anyway, it is simply required in order for chromedriver to work._
2. Download the latest .zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer/releases) and extract it to the desired directory.
3. Login to [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and create a new API application named `IMDBTraktSyncer`. In the "Redirect uri" field, enter `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`, then save the application.
4. Run `IMDBTraktSyncer.py` or open the terminal and navigate to the folder where `IMDBTraktSyncer.py` is located. Run `IMDBTraktSyncer.py` in the terminal.
5. Follow the prompts during the first run. You will need to enter your Trakt `client ID` and `client secret` from step 3, as well as your IMDB `username` and `password`. Please note that these details are saved insecurely as `credentials.txt` in the same folder as the script. It is recommended to change your IMDB password to something unique beforehand.
6. Setup is complete. The script will continue running and syncing your ratings. You can monitor its progress in the command line. See below for [setting up automation](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer#for-setting-up-automation-see-the-following-wiki-pages).

## Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Workarounds & Future Outlook
- If any of your details change (passwords, logins, API keys, etc.), simply open `credentials.txt`, modify your details, save it and then run the script again. Alternatively, delete `credentials.txt` to reset the script and it will prompt you to enter your new details on the next run.
- If IMDB requires a captcha on login, and you see "Not signed in" appear in the script, the captcha is likely the cause. To fix this, navigate to the IMDB website in your browser (preferably Chrome) from the same computer. If you're already logged in, log out and log back in. It may ask you to fill in a captcha. Complete the captcha and finish logging in. After successfully logging in on your browser, run the script again, and it should work. You may need to repeat this step several times if the issue persists. Adding a captcha solver to the script is being considered but not currently implemented. [Issue #2](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer/issues/2)
- If you see an error about having the incorrect version of Chromedriver, uninstall it by running the following command in the command line: `python -m pip uninstall chromedriver-py`. In your Chrome browser, go to Settings > About Chrome and check the prefix for your version (e.g., 112... or 111). If the prefix matches your Chrome version, navigate to the [chromedriver-py releases page](https://pypi.org/project/chromedriver-py/#history) and find the latest version that matches the prefix for your Chrome version. Copy the version number you need (e.g 113.0.5672.63), then run the following command in the command line: `python -m pip install chromedriver-py==VERSION_NUMBER`. Replace `VERSION_NUMBER` with the version you copied and press enter. This will install the correct version of Chromedriver. Run the script again, and it should work. [Issue #16](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer/issues/16)
- Due to IMDB's lack of API and rating import ability, this script uses an unconventional method that mimics using a web browser to set ratings on IMDB. Therefore, there are many points of failure that could arise. The script will be updated as best as possible.
