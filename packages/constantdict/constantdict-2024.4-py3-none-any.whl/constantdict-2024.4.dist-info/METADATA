# constantdict

An immutable dictionary class for Python, implemented as a thin layer around Python's builtin `dict` class. It is often [faster than other immutable dictionary implementations](https://matthiasdiener.github.io/constantdict/speed.html).

## Usage

Install this package with:
```
$ pip install constantdict
```

Usage example:
```python
from constantdict import constantdict

cd = constantdict({1: 2})

# constantdicts compare equal to dicts with the same items
assert cd == {1: 2}

# constantdicts are hashable, and their hashes are cached
print(hash(cd), cd)

# Attempting to modify the constantdict raises an AttributeError
try:
    # Similar for pop(), popitem(), clear(), del, and setdefault()
    cd[4] = 12
except AttributeError:
    pass
```

Please also see the [documentation](https://matthiasdiener.github.io/constantdict),
as well as the examples in the `examples/` directory.
