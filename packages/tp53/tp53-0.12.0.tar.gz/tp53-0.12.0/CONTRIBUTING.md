> [!NOTE]
> Upon the release of Poetry [v2.0.0](https://github.com/orgs/python-poetry/discussions/9793#discussioncomment-11043205), Poetry will automatically support bootstrap installation of [project-specific plugins](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/9547) and installation of the task runner will become automatic for this project.
> The `pyproject.toml` syntax will be:
> 
> ```toml

> requires-poetry = ">=2.0"
> 
> [tool.poetry.requires-plugins]
> poethepoet = ">=0.29"
> ```
