Here’s an example of how to use SwitchAI:  
```python  
from switchai import SwitchAI  

# Initialize the client with your chosen AI model or provider  
client = SwitchAI("gpt-4o")  

# Send a chat message to the AI  
response = client.chat(  
    messages=[  
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}  
    ]  
)
```
