# This demonstrates that STAR fails "cloneproofness":
#    https://electowiki.org/wiki/Independence_of_clone_alternatives
# The election ending in _1 is the normal election.  Brian wins.
# The election ending in _2 adds a clone of Amy, who gets nearly-identical votes.
# (Clone Of Amy gets an identical score, but I changed the preferences so Amy
# will win the runoff.)
