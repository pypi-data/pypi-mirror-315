Reweighted Range Voting (RRV) &ndash;
a <a href="PropRep.html">Proportional Representation</a>
voting method that feels like range voting
</H2>
<p><small>By Ivan Ryan with some contributions by Bruce R. Gilson.</small></p>
<p><small>This exposition by Ivan Ryan is intended to be easier to digest than our 
<a href="RRV.html">other RRV page</a>. Enjoy.</small></p>

<p>
The RRV procedure is
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter casts a ballot rating the candidates from 0 to M
</li><li>
Each ballot is given a weight equal to
<center>
weight = C/(C + sum of the scores given to all elected candidates on that
ballot)
</center>
</li><li>
Sum up all the ballots using those weightings
</li><li>
The candidate with the highest score wins and is declared elected
</li><li>
goto (2) unless all seats are filled
</li></ol>
<p>
The two parameters M and C are:
<pre>
M = maximum rating (say 10)
C = determines how proportionality occurs:
     C = M   &rArr; Greatest divisors (d'Hondt, Jefferson) proportionality
     C = M/2 &rArr; Major fractions (Webster, Sainte-Lague) method
</pre>
The C parameter mainly affects small parties.
</p>
<h3> Worked Example </h3>
<p>
As an example, assume there are 3 seats to be filled and 2 parties "A" and "B."
I am going to assume C=M (it doesn't make any difference here) and
the max rating is M=10.  Party A puts forward three candidates A1,A2,A3, while
party B runs two: B1 and B2.
</p><p>
I am going to assume that each voter from each party votes the same way:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><pre>
<b>60 "party A" voters:</b>    <b>40 "party B" voters:</b>
A1: 10                  A1: 0
A2: 9                   A2: 0
A3: 8                   A3: 0
B1: 1                   B1: 10
B2: 0                   B2: 10
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The first round is easy, you just add up all the totals:
</p>
<a name="inittot"></a>
<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><pre>
A1: <b>600</b>
A2: 540
A3: 480
B1: 460
B2: 400
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A1 is the first winner, since he has the most votes.
</p><p>
The weights then need to be recalculated. 
In practice this would have to be done on a
ballot by ballot basis. 
But since in our example everyone in each party votes
the same way, here it only needs to be done once for each
party.
</p><p>
Remembering that the formula for the weightings is
<center>
weight = C/(C+Sum of ratings given to elected candidates),
</center>
<br>
we get that
</p>
<table bgcolor="#ffcc88"><tr><td><pre>
ROUND 2 BALLOT-WEIGHTS:
Party A voters get weight = 10/(10+10) = 0.5
Party B voters get weight = 10/(10+0)  = 1.0 (as they rated A1 as 0)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
So round 2 uses these weighted votes:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><pre>
60 @ 0.5 = 30 "party A" votes:
  <font color="red">A1: 10</font>
  A2: 9
  A3: 8
  B1: 1
  B2: 0

40 @ 1.0 = 40 "party B" votes:
  <font color="red">A1: 0</font>
  A2: 0
  A3: 0
  B1: 10
  B2: 10
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
We compute the totals (weighted sums) finding:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><pre>
A2: 270
A3: 240
B1: <b>430</b>
B2: 400
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Observe that the deweighting of party-A voters causes the party-B
choice B1 to win the 2nd round.  
<small>The A's don't "deserve" as much power in the second round since they got their way in the
first round.  But while RRV can be interpreted as thus obeying "moral principles" it was not designed
using morals.  The weight formula was designed to make a proportionality theorem work.
Any morality of it is merely a side effect of that.</small>
</p>
<p>
For the third round, the weightings are calculated again using
<center>
weight = C/(C+Sum of ratings given to elected candidates),
</center>
<br>
We get that
</p>
<table bgcolor="#88ccff"><tr><td><pre>
ROUND 3 BALLOT WEIGHTS:
Party A voters get  weight = 10/(10+10+1) = 0.476 (as they rated A1 at 10 and B1 at 1)
Party B voters get  weight = 10/(10+10)   = 0.5 (as they rated B1 as 10)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
So round 3 uses these weighted votes:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><pre>
60 @ 0.476 = 28.6 "party A" votes:
  <font color="red">A1: 10</font>
  A2: 9
  A3: 8
  <font color="red">B1: 1</font>
  B2: 0

40 @ 0.5 = 20 "party B" votes
  <font color="red">A1: 0</font>
  A2: 0
  A3: 0
  <font color="red">B1: 10</font>
  B2: 10
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The totals are:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><pre>
A2: <b>257</b>
A3: 229
B2: 200
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
So A2 wins the last round.
</p>
<p>
<b>The final result</b> is then that <b>A1, A2, and B1 win</b>.
</p><p>
This gives proportionality between the two parties.
<small>If we had just picked the top three
range voting finishers without any reweighting, 
<a href="#inittot">then</a>
we'd have gotten 100% party-A
winners, which would have disproportionally denied representation to the 40% of the 
population who were B-voters.</small>
</p><p>
However, if the voters didn't vote so robotically along party lines, then it would be
messier.
