# This test was an experiment.  I had a theory that maybe I could make multiwinner
# elections cheaper to calculate:
#
#    If you have an N-way tie for first, and more than N seats left to fill,
#    simply advance all the tied winners.
#
# But this doesn't work, as it can change the results.  This test election
# demonstrates how.  We're using Bloc STAR to fill 3 seats.
# Amy ties for first in the first score round--and outright wins subsequent
# score rounds--but always loses in the automatic runoff rounds.
#
# Note that if you don't specify a candidate in a ballot, they get a score of
# 0 automatically.  As long as every candidate is explicitly mentioned at
# least once in a ballot somewhere, they'll be a valid candidate.
