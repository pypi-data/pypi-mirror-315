#
#     A STAR voting ranking of candidates can be done by using the
#     Bloc STAR voting procedure: find the STAR winner, put them in
#     1st place, then remove them from the election, and repeat,
#     putting each consecutive STAR winner in a lower rank than all
#     previous STAR winners. Optionally, if two candidates tie in the
#     automatic runoff during this procedure, they can both be put as
#     tied for the same rank, and then both are removed from the
#     election. Note that while STAR voting can never put someone
#     ranked 3rd or worse by Score voting as 1st i.e. its winner
#     (when run on the same ballots; this is because only the two
#     candidates ranked highest by Score voting can enter the STAR
#     automatic runoff and thus even be eligible to win), it can put
#     the candidate Score ranked 1st (i.e. the Score winner) as its
#     last place candidate using this procedure, since the Score
#     winner may be a Condorcet loser i.e. a candidate who would
#     lose an automatic runoff against any other candidate.

# Let me draw your attention to the second sentence:
#
#     Optionally, if two candidates tie in the automatic runoff
#     during this procedure, they can both be put as tied for the
#     same rank, and then both are removed from the election.
#
# The rest of that paragraph goes on to say why this isn't a good
# idea.  Basically, one of the first two winners could be a
# Condorcet loser--they lose in head-to-head runoff against any
# other candidate.
#
# This election demonstrates this happening.  Condorcet Loser
# completely ties with First for the first seat, requiring a
# tiebreaker.  The tiebreaker gives the first seat to First.
# Condorcet Loser then goes on to lose in every subsequent
# election, coming in last place.  If we gave seats to both
# candidates that tied in the first round, Condorcet Loser
# would have gotten a seat--and I don't think that's what the
# STAR Voting folks would have wanted.
