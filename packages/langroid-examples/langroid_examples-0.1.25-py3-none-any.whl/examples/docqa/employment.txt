EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This Employment Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between QuickTech Innovations Inc. ("Company") and Jamie Fox ("Employee"). The Employee is engaged to commence employment on January 1, 2024, in the role of Senior Software Developer. Throughout their tenure, the Employee is to commit fully to their designated duties and adhere to all Company policies. The Employee is expected to bring their full professional focus and efforts to the Company. This Agreement outlines an initial term of employment, which, while finite, may be subject to changes under certain conditions.

The Employee will be compensated with an annual salary of $120,000, paid in bi-weekly installments. In addition to the salary, the Employee may receive bonuses and other forms of incentive compensation, the conditions of which are documented separately. Employee benefits, including health insurance and retirement plans, will be provided as per Company policy and may be modified from time to time. While compensation is a critical component, this Agreement also contemplates circumstances under which the relationship may evolve or conclude.

Either the Employee or the Company can terminate this Agreement with a 30-day written notice. In specific scenarios where the Company terminates for cause, the Employee may forfeit entitlements to certain benefits. Conversely, should the Employee decide to terminate their employment without cause, this action could affect their post-employment benefits. The Company also retains the right to terminate without cause, subject to the provision of severance as per Company policy. The next section details the measures in place following the cessation of the employment period.

Note that these may be modified by mutual agreement between the Employee and the Company.
 Health benefits will paid for a period of up to 3 months, or until the Employee finds new coverage, whichever comes first. There will be a one-time payment of $20,000. However, if the Employee engages in any activity that is in direct competition with the Company, the Employee will forfeit this payment.

Regular performance evaluations will be conducted to ensure the Employee meets the Company's expectations. The duties assigned to the Employee are subject to business needs and can be modified at the Company's discretion. This Agreement is designed to clarify the employment relationship but is not an assurance of perpetual employment. It may only be amended through written agreement by both parties, thus establishing a clear structure for employment terms and future adjustments.
