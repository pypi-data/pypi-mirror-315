Description: # WebSpeechRecognition Library
        
        ## Introduction
        
        WebSpeechRecognition is a Python library that helps turn speech into text in real time. It uses the Selenium WebDriver and the HTML5 Web Speech API. This tool is built to work with Chrome WebDriver and is easy to use for speech recognition tasks.
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install WebSpeechRecognition, you can use pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install WebSpeechRecognition
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        - **Works in Many Languages:** You can set the language you want using simple codes like "en-US" for English.
        - **Change Language Easily:** You can pick a language at any time while using it.
        - **Simple Functions:** It has easy-to-understand methods to start and stop speech recognition.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Initialization
        
        To start using WebSpeechRecognition, initialize the `SpeechRecognition` class with the path to your ChromeDriver executable and the language code:
        
        ```python
        from WebSpeechRecognition import SpeechRecognition
        
        recognizer = SpeechRecognition("path/to/chromedriver", language="en-US")
        recognizer.Init()
        ```
        
        ### Speech Recognition
        
        To start listening and transcribing speech, use the `Listen` method. This method returns the transcribed text:
        
        ```python
        text = recognizer.Listen(print_allowed=True)
        print(f"You said: {text}")
        ```
        
        ### Close the Driver
        
        Once you are done, use the `Quit` method to close the ChromeDriver instance:
        
        ```python
        recognizer.Quit()
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        Here is a complete example:
        
        ```python
        from WebSpeechRecognition import SpeechRecognition
        
        recognizer = SpeechRecognition("path/to/chromedriver", language="en-US")
        recognizer.Init()
        
        while True:
            try:
                text = recognizer.Listen(print_allowed=True)
                print(f"You said: {text}")
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                recognizer.Quit()
                break
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Parameters
        
        ### `SpeechRecognition(driver_path, language)`
        - `driver_path`: The path to the Chrome WebDriver file.
        - `language`: The language code for recognition (default: "en-US").
        
        ### `Init()`
        Sets up the WebDriver with options for speech recognition.
        
        ### `Listen(print_allowed=False)`
        Starts listening and returns the text it hears.
        - `print_allowed`: If True, prints recognized text to the console.
        
        ### `Quit()`
        Stops the WebDriver and closes everything.
