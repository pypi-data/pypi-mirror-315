         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        			    Preamble
        
          The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
        License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
        General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
        using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
        the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
        your programs, too.
        
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
        in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
        
          To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
        These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
        distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
        
          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
        you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
        source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
        rights.
        
          We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
        (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
        distribute and/or modify the software.
        
          Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
        that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
        software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
        want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
        that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
        authors' reputations.
        
          Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
        patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
        program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
        program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
        patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
        
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.
                
        		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
        
          0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
        a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
        refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
        means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
        that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
        either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
        language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
        the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
        
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
        running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
        is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
        Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
        Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
        
          1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
        and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
        along with the Program.
        
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
        
          2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
            a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        
            b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
            whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
            part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
            parties under the terms of this License.
        
            c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
            announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
            notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
            a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
            these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
            License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
            does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
            the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
        sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
        on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
        
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
        collective works based on the Program.
        
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
        with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
        the scope of this License.
        
          3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
            a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
            source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
            1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
        
            b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
            years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
            cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
            customarily used for software interchange; or,
        
            c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
            to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
            allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form with such
            an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
        
        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
        making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
        code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
        associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
        control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
        special exception, the source code distributed need not include
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
        form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
        operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
        itself accompanies the executable.
        
        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                
          4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
        except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
        void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
        However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
        this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
        parties remain in full compliance.
        
          5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Program or works based on it.
        
          6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
        these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
        You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
        this License.
        
          7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
        may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
        
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
        any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
        apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
        circumstances.
        
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
        integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
        implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
        impose that choice.
        
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                
          8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
        original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
        may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
        those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
        countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
        the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
        
          9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns.
        
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
        later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
        Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
        this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.
        
          10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
        to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
        Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
        make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
        of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
        of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
        
        			    NO WARRANTY
        
          11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
        FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
        OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
        PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
        OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
        TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
        PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
        REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        
          12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
        INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
        OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
        TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
        YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
        PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
        		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                
        	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        
            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        
            This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
            the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.
        
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
            GNU General Public License for more details.
        
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
        
        
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
        when it starts in an interactive mode:
        
            Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
            Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
        
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
        be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
        mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
        
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
        school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
        necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
        
          Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
          `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
        proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
        consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
        library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
        Public License instead of this License.

# Snapm

Snapshot manager (snapm) is a tool for managing sets of snapshots on Linux
systems.  The snapm tool allows snapshots of multiple volumes to be captured at
the same time, representing the system state at the time the set was created.

The tool has a modular plugin architecture allowing different snapshot backends
to be used together. Currently snapshots using LVM2 copy-on-write and thinly
provisioned snapshots are supported.

## Building and installing Snapm

A `setuptools` based build script is provided: local installations and
package builds can be performed by running `python setup.py` and a
setup command. See `python setup.py --help` for detailed information on
the available options and commands.

The `snapm` command uses the [boom boot manager][5] to manage boot entries for
the snapshots that it creates. If installing `snapm` manually, Install `boom`
first: either from your distribution repositories or the upstream Git repo.
Snapshot manager is tested with boom-1.6.4 and later.

### Building an RPM package
A spec file is included in the repository that can be used to build RPM packages
of snapm. The packit service is also enabled for new pull requests and will
automatically build packages for fedora-stable, fedora-development, epel-9,
centos-stream-9, and centos-stream-10.

## The snapm command

The `snapm` command is the main interface to the snapshot manager.  It is able
to create, delete, and display snapshots and snapshot sets and provides reports
listing the snapshots and snapshot sets available on the system.

Snapm commands normally operate on a particular object type: a snapshot set or an
individual snapshot.

```
# snapm snapset <command> <options> # `snapset` command
```

```
# snapm snapshot <command> <options> # `snapshot` command
```

### Snapshot sets

Snapshot manager groups snapshots taken at the same moment in time into a named
"snapshot set", or snapset. This allows the snapshots to be managed as a single
unit and simplifies the management of snapshots of multiple volumes. Each
snapshot set must contain at least one snapshot.

### Snapm subcommands
#### snapset
The `snapset` subcommand is used to create, delete, rename, activate,
deactivate, list and display snapsets.

##### create
Create a new snapset with the provided name and list of sources (mount point
or block device paths):
```
# snapm snapset create [-b|--bootable] [-r|--revert] <name> source...
```
###### Size Policies
Size policies can be used to control the size of fixed-sized snapshots and to
check for available space when creating a snapshot set.

Some snapshot implementations (Lvm2CoW) require a fixed size to be specified
for the snapshot backstore when the snapshot is created. The default size
allocated by snapshot manager is 2x the current file system usage, allowing the
existing content of the volume to be overwritten twice before exhausting the
snapshot space.

Plugins for snapshot providers that do not require a fixed snapshot size will
check that space is available for the requested size policy at snapshot set
creation time.

Size policy hints can be manually given on the command line to override the
default behavior on a per-source path basis. Four policies are available:

 * FIXED - a fixed size given on the command line
 * FREE - a percentage fraction of the free space available
 * USED - a percentage fraction of the space currently used on the mount point
   (may be greater than 100%)
 * SIZE - a percentage fraction of the origin device size from 0 to 100%

The FIXED size policy accepts optional units of KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB
and ZiB. Units may be abbreviated to the first character.

The USED size policy can only be applied to mounted file systems.

Per-source path size policies are specified by adding a ':' and the required
policy to the corresponding mount point path, for example:


```
# snapm snapset create backup /:2G /var:1G /home
```

```
# snapm snapset create backup /:25%FREE /var:25%FREE /home
```

```
# snapm snapset create backup /:100%USED /var:100%USED /home
```

```
# snapm snapset create backup /:100%SIZE /var:100%SIZE /home
```

If no size policy is specified the default is `200%USED` for mounted file
systems and 25%SIZE for unmounted block devices. To ensure a volume can be
completely overwritten specify `100%SIZE`. This requires more storage capacity
but avoids the possibility of the snapshot running out of space.

A default size policy for all source paths that do not specify an explicit
per-path policy can be set with the `--size-policy` argument:

```
# snapm snapset create backup --size-policy 100%SIZE / /home /var
```

On success the `snapm snapset create` command displays the newly created
snapshot set on stdout:

```
# snapm snapset create -br --size-policy 100%USED backup / /home /var
SnapsetName:      backup
Sources:          /, /home, /var
NrSnapshots:      3
Time:             2024-12-05 19:10:44
UUID:             d3f5e3cd-a383-5dba-b597-9134a2c426e9
Status:           Active
Autoactivate:     yes
Bootable:         yes
BootEntries:
  SnapshotEntry:  f574a20
  RevertEntry:    f428f9f
```

##### delete
Delete an existing snapset by name or uuid.
```
# snapm snapset delete <name|uuid>
```

##### rename
Rename an existing snapset.
```
# snapm snapset rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

##### revert
Revert an existing snapset, re-setting the content of the origin volumes
to the state they were in at the time the snapset was created. The snapset
to be reverted may be specified either by its name or uuid.

```
# snapm snapset revert <name|uuid>
```

If the origins of the snapshot set are in use at the time of the revert the
operation is deferred until the next time the snapshot set is activated (for
example during a reboot). If a revert boot entry was created for the snapshot
set the `revert` command will suggest booting into it to continue:

```
# snapm snapset revert upgrade
WARNING - Snaphot set upgrade origin is in use: reboot required to complete revert
Boot into 'Revert upgrade 2024-06-10 15:25:15 (6.8.9-300.fc40.x86_64)' to continue
```

##### resize
Resize the members on an existing snapset, applying a new size policy to
specified sources or applying a new default size policy to all snapshots within
a snapset.

Resize the `/var` member of the snapshot set named upgrade to 100%SIZE:

```
# snapm snapset resize upgrade /var:100%SIZE
```

Resize each member of the snapshot set named backup to the 200%USED size
policy:

```
# snapm snapset resize backup --size-policy 200%USED
```

##### activate
Activate the members of an existing snapset, or all snapsets if no name or
uuid argument is given.
```
# snapm snapset activate [<name|uuid>]
```

##### deactivate
Deactivate the members of an existing snapset, or all snapsets if no name or
uuid argument is given.
```
# snapm snapset deactivate [<name|uuid>]
```

##### autoactivate
Enable or disable autoactivation for the snapshots in a snapshot set.
```
# snapm snapset autoactivate [--yes|--no] [<name|uuid>]
```

##### list
List available snapsets matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapset list [<name|uuid>]
```

By default the information is presented as a tabular report with column headings
indicating the meaning of each value. The default column selection includes the
SnapsetName, Time, NrSnapshots, Status, and MountPoints fields:

```
# snapm snapset list
SnapsetName  Time                 NrSnapshots Status  Sources
backup       2024-12-05 19:14:03            3 Active  /, /home, /var
upgrade      2024-12-05 19:14:09            2 Active  /, /var
```

Custom field specifications may be given with the `-o`/`--options` argument. To
obtain a list of available fields run `snapm snapset list -o+help`:

```
# snapm snapset list -o+help
Snapshot set Fields
-------------------
  name         - Snapshot set name [str]
  uuid         - Snapshot set UUID [uuid]
  timestamp    - Snapshot set creation time as a UNIX epoch value [num]
  time         - Snapshot set creation time [time]
  nr_snapshots - Number of snapshots [num]
  sources      - Snapshot set sources [strlist]
  mountpoints  - Snapshot set mount points [strlist]
  devices      - Snapshot set devices [strlist]
  status       - Snapshot set status [str]
  autoactivate - Autoactivation status [str]
  bootable     - Configured for snapshot boot [str]
  bootentry    - Snapshot set boot entry [sha]
  revertentry  - Snapshot set revert boot entry [sha]

```

To specify custom fields pass a comma separated list to `-o`:

```
# snapm snapset list -oname,time
SnapsetName  Time
backup       2024-12-05 19:14:03
upgrade      2024-12-05 19:14:09
```

To add fields to the default field set prefix the list of fields with the `+`
character:

```
# snapm snapset list -o+bootentry,revertentry
SnapsetName  Time                 NrSnapshots Status  Sources        SnapshotEntry RevertEntry
backup       2024-12-05 19:14:03            3 Active  /, /home, /var 41573a414f9d5 1cc5bc59c9b90
upgrade      2024-12-05 19:14:09            2 Active  /, /var        a60dab4d3fb36 4ce6b27f16f30
```

The report can also be produced in JSON notation, suitable for parsing by other
tools using the `--json` argument:

```
# snapm snapset list --json
{
    "Snapsets": [
        {
            "snapset_name": "backup",
            "snapset_time": "2024-12-05 19:14:03",
            "snapset_nr_snapshots": 3,
            "snapset_status": "Active",
            "snapset_sources": [
                "/",
                "/home",
                "/var"
            ]
        },
        {
            "snapset_name": "upgrade",
            "snapset_time": "2024-12-05 19:14:09",
            "snapset_nr_snapshots": 2,
            "snapset_status": "Active",
            "snapset_sources": [
                "/",
                "/var"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For further report formatting options refer to the `snapm(8)` manual page.

##### show
Display available snapsets matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapset show [<name|uuid>]
```

By default the output is formatted in the same way as the output of the `snapm
snapset create` command:

```
# snapm snapset show upgrade
SnapsetName:      upgrade
Sources:          /, /var
NrSnapshots:      2
Time:             2024-12-05 19:14:09

Autoactivate:     yes
Bootable:         yes
BootEntries:
  SnapshotEntry:  a60dab4
  RevertEntry:    4ce6b27
```


The individual snapshots making up each set are also displayed if `--members` is
used:

```

upgrade      Active  /dev/fedora/home-snapset_upgrade_1733426499_-home
```

To add fields to the default field set prefix the list of fields with the `+`
character:

```
# snapm snapshot list -o+devpath
SnapsetName  Name                                         Origin           Source  Status  Size   Free   Autoactivate Provider  DevicePath

The output is a JSON array of dictionaries describing each configured snapshot.

#### plugin
The `plugin` command is used to display information on the available snapshot
provider plugins.

##### plugin list

The `plugin list` command lists the available plugins:

```
# snapm plugin list
PluginName PluginVersion PluginType
lvm2-cow   0.1.0         Lvm2CowSnapshot
lvm2-thin  0.1.0         Lvm2ThinSnapshot
stratis    0.1.0         StratisSnapshot
```

### Reporting commands

The `snapm snapset list` and `snapm snapshot list` commands generate
a tabular report as output. To control the list of displayed fields
use the `-o/--options FIELDS` argument:

```
# snapm snapset list -oname,sources
SnapsetName  Sources
backup       /, /home, /var
userdata     /data, /home
```

To add extra fields to the default selection, prefix the field list
with the `+` character:

```
# snapm snapset list -o+uuid
SnapsetName  Time                 NrSnapshots Status   Sources        UUID
backup       2024-12-05 19:26:28            3 Active   /, /home, /var 53514020-e88d-5f53-bf09-42c6ab6e325d
userdata     2024-12-05 19:26:45            2 Inactive /data, /home   e8d58051-7a94-5802-8328-54661ab1a70f
```

To display the available fields for either report use the field
name `help`.
