## Usage

This tool creates the directory structure (including the control file) to then create a .deb package with `dpkg-deb`.

You may provide a template for the control file (see [Control File Template](#control-file-template)) or provide the metadata directly via the command line or environment variables.

You may also provide files to include in the package with `-f/--file` option, which may be passed multiple times.

You may also provide a source for the metadata (see [Metadata Sources](#metadata-sources)). You can also specify specific metadata values via the command line. If no metadata source is provided, and all the required metadata is not provided via the command line, an error will be raised.

```sh
OUT_DIR=$(debby -f path/to/binary /usr/bin/binary -f path/to/config /etc/config --pyproject pyproject.toml)
dpkg-deb --build $OUT_DIR
```

### Scripts

You may provide installation scripts with `--preinst`, `--postinst`, `--prerm`, and `--postrm`. These scripts will be included in the package and run before and after installation and removal of the package.

Using a script flag without a path is equivalent to providing a path to a script in the current directory with the same name as the flag. For example, `--preinst` is equivalent to `--preinst ./preinst`.

Alternatively, you may directly provide commands to run at the appropriate stage with `--preinst-cmd`, `--postinst-cmd`, `--prerm-cmd`, and `--postrm-cmd`. An appropriate script will be generated and included in the package. For example, `--preinst-cmd 'echo hello' --preinst-cmd 'echo world'` will generate a script that runs `echo hello` and `echo world` in sequence as the pre-installation script.

### Metadata Sources

Currently, the following metadata sources are supported:

- `--pyproject`: Reads the metadata from the given pyproject.toml file, according to the [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) specification.
- `--poetry`: Reads the metadata from the given pyproject.toml file, according to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/)'s specification.

### Control File Template

It is possible to provide a template for the control file with `-t/--template path/to/control.template`. If provided, this template will be used to generate the control file instead of creating one from scratch. The template should be a text file with the following allowed placeholders.
