    The main function to start and execute the game.

    It initializes the game, allows the player to create a character, 
    triggers a random event to modify player stats, and starts a combat session 
    between the player and an NPC. After the battle concludes, it displays the 
    result and ends the game.

    Flow:
    1. Display the game title with ASCII art.
    2. Create a player character and an NPC opponent.
    3. Trigger a random event that can positively or negatively impact the player's stats.
    4. Display updated stats for the player and NPC.
    5. Start and manage a turn-based combat sequence.
    6. Display the winner and a closing message.

    Note:
    - The player's and NPC's stats are updated dynamically during the event and combat.
    - ASCII art and visual elements enhance the gaming experience.
