# Starlyng Server Metrics

This project gathers metrics for local or hosted servers that can be run on a server used to post data to Grafana and Prometheus.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Python 3.x.
* You have a basic understanding of Python and virtual environments.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To set up your development environment and run the project, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git https://github.com/starlyngapp/server-metrics.git
cd server-metrics
```

## Create and Activate Virtual Environment

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Setup Environment for VSCode

* Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
* Search for the Python: Create Environment command, and select it
* Select Venv
* Select Python interpreter
* Select dependencies to install

## Install Required Packages

Install all dependencies listed in the dev-requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## Installation

To install only the package (without dev dependencies):

```bash
pip install starlyng_server_metrics
```

To install development dependencies (useful for contributing to the project):

```bash
pip install starlyng_server_metrics[dev]
```

Alternatively, you can install the development dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## Environment Configuration

To configure the server metrics collection, you need to set up environment variables. This can be done by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project.

An example `.env` file is provided as `.env.example`. You can copy this file and update the values as needed.

### Steps to Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example environment file:**

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Open the `.env` file and update the values:**

```env
# .env
# List of server IPs and ports in the format ip:port, separated by commas
SERVERS=192.168.1.1:22,192.168.1.2:22

# Path to the SSH private key
KEY_PATH=/path/to/your/.ssh/id_rsa

# SSH username
USERNAME=your_username
```

3. **Save the `.env` file.**

The `SERVERS` variable should be a comma-separated list of server IP addresses and ports. The `KEY_PATH` should point to the SSH private key file you will use for authentication, and `USERNAME` should be the SSH username.

## Usage

To run the main function:

```bash
server_metrics
```

## PyPI

[starlyng-server-metrics](https://pypi.org/project/starlyng-server-metrics/)

## Command-line Arguments

You can also override configuration using command-line arguments:

```bash
server_metrics --servers "192.168.1.1:22,192.168.1.2:22" --key_path "/path/to/your/.ssh/id_rsa" --username "your_username"
```

Or locally:

```bash
python main.py --servers "192.168.1.1:22,192.168.1.2:22" --key_path "/path/to/your/.ssh/id_rsa" --username "your_username"
```

### Building and Uploading Your Package

1. **Build the package**:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

2. **Upload to PyPI**:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

Upload using specific project name referenced in .pypirc

```bash
twine upload dist/* --repository starlyng-server-metrics
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pytest
```

This command will run all tests and report the results. You can also run specific tests by providing the path and filename of the test file.
