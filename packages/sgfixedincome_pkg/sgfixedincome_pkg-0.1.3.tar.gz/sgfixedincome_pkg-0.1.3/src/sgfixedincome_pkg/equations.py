    Calculate the dollar return from an investment based on its rate of return

        investment (float): The initial amount invested in dollars.
        rate (float): The annual rate of return in percentage (%).

    Returns:
        float: The dollar return from the investment after the given tenure.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If investment or rate is negative, or tenure is non-positive (zero or negative).

        tenure (int): The tenure of the investment in months.
