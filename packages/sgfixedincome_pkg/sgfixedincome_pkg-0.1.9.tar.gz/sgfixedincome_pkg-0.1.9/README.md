A python package to aggregate and analyse data on SGD-denominated retail fixed income products in Singapore.

Are you a non-technical user? Use the app [here](https://sgfixedincome.streamlit.app/).

## Introduction

This python package contains:

- `scraper.py`: A generalized web scraper to extract data on fixed deposit rates from bank websites that display this data in a suitable table format.
- `mas_api_client.py`: An API client that interacts with several Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) bonds and bills API endpoints. In particular, we provide functions to extract data on Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) and Treasury bills (T-bills).
- `consolidate.py`: Functions to format, merge, and consolidate data obtained from scraping bank websites and from the MAS API.
- `analysis.py`: Functions to analyse and visualise extracted fixed income product data.
- `streamlit_app/app.py`: code for streamlit web interface 

## Installation

The package can be installed using:

```bash
$ pip install sgfixedincome_pkg
```

### Running the Web Interface
After installation, find the installation location with:
```bash
$ pip show sgfixedincome_pkg
```

Then run:
```bash
$ streamlit run "C:\Path\To\site-packages\sgfixedincome_pkg\streamlit_app\app.py"
```

For example:
```bash
$ streamlit run "C:\Users\John\Desktop\Folder\test_env\Lib\site-packages\sgfixedincome_pkg\streamlit_app\app.py"
```

This will open a browser window with an interactive dashboard.

Note: The web interface requires an active internet connection to fetch current rates and product information.
