# rawplot
 
 Collection of plotting commands to analyze RGB imagers producing Bayer RAW images, such as DSLR cameras or other imagers (i.e RasPi HQ camera) using matplotlib. Its purpose is helping characterize the camera sensor performance and key figures such as gain and read noise.

 This is a child project of [AZOTEA](https://guaix.ucm.es/azoteaproject), an initiative to monitor light pollution through digital imagers. The AZOTEA initiative was started in EU funded project ACTION - Participatory science toolkit against pollution, Grant 824603.


 ## Installation

It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment and activate it, then install rawplot from PyPi

```bash
$ mkdir rawplot
$ cd rawplot
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip install rawplot

```
# Usage

The available commands list can be found in the `bin` virtual environment sub-folder.

 ```bash
 ls -1 .venv/bin/raw*
.venv/bin/rawplot-hv
.venv/bin/rawplot-image
.venv/bin/rawplot-imarith
.venv/bin/rawplot-linearity
.venv/bin/rawplot-master
.venv/bin/rawplot-photodiode
.venv/bin/rawplot-plan
.venv/bin/rawplot-ptc
.venv/bin/rawplot-snr
.venv/bin/rawplot-spectral
 ```

## Common options

All utilities share these command line options, mainly used for debugging purposes:

* `‚Åªh, --help` shows program's options and exit
* `--version` show program's version numbe and exit.
* `--console` log debugging messages to console. Default level is `INFO`.
* `--log-file` log debugging messages to file.  Default level is `INFO`.
* `--verbose`  raises debugging level to `DEBUG`.
* `--quiet` lowers debugging level to `WARN`.

## Other common options using in many commands

### subsampling

* `--every` <N> Picks or subsamples an object retaled with the command (pick every N images in a file list, subsamples points in a histogram by /N, etc.)

### Color planes selection

Since we are dealing with RAW images, we are dealing with 4 separate color planes (channels): `R Gr Gb B`. Most of the commands supports being run on all or a subset of these color planes.

* `-c | --channel` Specify which of the R, Gr, Gb, or B channels to handle by the command. Can be one or a combination of them. Some commands accept a G channel
(an average of Gr and Gb)

Order in the command line is not important. They are internally reordered so that the display & processing order is (R, Gr, Gb, B)

Valid Examples:
```bash
--channel B
--channel Gr Gb   
--channel R G B
--channel Gr R B Gb
```
Invalid Examples:

```bash
--channel B B (duplicated)
--channel R A (A is not supported)
--channel R G B Gb (this commbination is not supported)
```

### Region of Interest (ROI)

A ROI is specified given its starting point `(x0, y0)` and dimensions `(width, height)`. To unifomingly address the different resolutions in camera formats, a normalized ROI is used as input, where both the starting point and dimensions are normalized between 0 and 1. In addition `x0+width <= 1.0` and `y0+height <= 1.0`. When the `(x0,y0)` starting point is not specified in the command line, the `(width,height)` dimensions are assumed with respect to the image center.

The different ROI parameters on the command line can be specified as either as decimals or fractions for convenience.
Width and height parameters can be specified with `-wi | --width` and `-he | --height`.

Example:
```
--x0 0.2 --y0 0.1 --width 1/3 --height 1/4 
```

Only when an image file is open, this normalized ROI transforms into a physical ROI with pixels. When the physcal ROI is displayed in several graphs, it is done using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) matrix style `[y0:y1,x0:x1]`.

# Commands

Examples of usage can be found in chapter 7 (Tools) of [GONet all sky camera calibration](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11183813) report along with the [dataset on which the usage examples are based](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11125041).

The camera itself was a [Raspberry Pi HQ Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/), installed in a [GoNET project](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351459667_The_GONet_Ground_Observing_Network_Camera_An_Inexpensive_Light_Pollution_Monitoring_System) device.

## Photon Transfer Curves (PTC)

An series of PTC charts, based on the classic [Photon Transfer](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ebooks/PM/Photon-Transfer/eISBN-9780819478382/10.1117/3.725073#_=_) book have been included so far:

The curves are based on the following simplified detector model, whose noise variances given by:

```math
\sigma_{TOTAL}^2 = \sigma_{READ}^2 + \sigma_{SHOT}^2 + \sigma_{FPN}^2 \quad [e^-]
```

Where $\sigma_{READ}$ is the detector read noise, $\sigma_{SHOT}$ is the signal-dependent Poisson noise ($\sigma_{SHOT} = S^{1/2}$), and $\sigma_{FPN}$ is a fixed spatial pattern noise, not all pixels being equal, being also modeled as a signal-dependent noise $\sigma_{FPN} = P_{FPN}S$, where $P_{FPN} \ll 1$.

Working with digital numbers [DN] - instead of electrons - equation above is rewritten as:

```math
\sigma_{TOTAL}^2 = \sigma_{READ}^2 + (S/g) + (P_{FPN}S)^2 \quad [DN]
```
