  Long-range axons are fundamental to brain connectivity and
  functional organization, enabling communication between
  different regions of the brain. Recent advances in
  experimental techniques have yielded a substantial number
  of whole-brain axonal reconstructions. While most previous
  computational generative models of neurons have
  predominantly focused on dendrites, generating realistic
  axonal morphologies is challenging due to their distinct
  targeting. In this study, we present a novel algorithm for
  axon synthesis that combines algebraic topology with the
  Steiner tree algorithm, an extension of the minimum
  spanning tree, to generate both the local and long-range
  compartments of axons. We demonstrate that our
  computationally generated axons closely replicate
  experimental data in terms of their morphological
  properties. This approach enables the generation of
  biologically accurate long-range axons that span large
  distances and connect multiple brain regions, advancing
  the digital reconstruction of the brain. Ultimately, our
  approach opens up new possibilities for large-scale
  in-silico simulations, advancing research into brain
  function and disorders.
