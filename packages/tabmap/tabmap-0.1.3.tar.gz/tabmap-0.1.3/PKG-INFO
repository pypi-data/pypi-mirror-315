        License
        
        THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
        
        BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
        
        1. Definitions
        
             a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
        
             b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
        
             c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
        
             d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
        
             e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
        
             f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
        
        2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
        
        3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
        
             a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
        
             b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
        
        The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).
        
        4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
        
             a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
        
             b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
        
             c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
        
             d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
        
                  i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
        
                  ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
        
             e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
        
        5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
        
        UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
        6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
        7. Termination
        
             a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
        
             b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
        
        8. Miscellaneous

# TabMap

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tabmap.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tabmap)
### Interpretable Discovery of Patterns in Tabular Data via Spatially Semantic Topographic Maps
Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2024. [HTML](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01268-6) | [PDF](https://rdcu.be/dW1Iy) | [Cite](#citation)

**TL;DR:** Python implementation of TabMap proposed in [our paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01268-6).

- TabMap unravels intertwined relationships in tabular data by transforming each data sample into a spatially semantic 2D topographic map, which we refer to as TabMap.
- A TabMap preserves the original feature values as pixel intensities, with the relationships among the features spatially encoded in the map (the strength of two inter-related features correlates with their distance on the map).
- Our approach makes it possible to apply 2D convolutional neural networks to extract association patterns in the data to facilitate data analysis, and offers interpretability by ranking features according to importance.
- We demonstrate TabMap's superior predictive performance across a diverse set of biomedical datasets.

* NVIDIA GPU (Tested on Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000 48G x 1) on local workstations
* Python (3.10.13), torch (1.13.1), numpy (1.23.1), pandas (1.5.3), scikit-learn (1.4.2), scipy (1.10.1), seaborn (0.12.2); For further details on the software and package versions used, please refer to the `tabmap_conda.yml` file.

## Train and evaluate the TabMap classifier
### TabMap construction: transforming tabular data into 2D topographic maps
```python
from tabmap_construction import TabMapGenerator
generator = TabMapGenerator(metric='correlation', loss_fun='kl_loss')
X_tabmap = generator.fit_transform(X)
```

#### Parameters:
* **metric**: Metric used to compute the feature inter-relationships. *{'correlation', 'euclidean', 'gower'}*
* **loss_fun**: Loss function used for computing the optimal transport. *{'kl_loss', 'sqeuclidean', 'square_loss'}*
* **epsilon**: Entropic regularization parameter (>=0). *default=0 (no regularization applied)*
* **version**: Version of the distance matrix calculation algorithm. *default='v2.0'*
  * Versions 'v1.0' and 'v2.0' use different methods for computing grid distances.
* **num_iter**: Number of iterations for the optimal transport problem. *default=10*

#### TabMapGenerator class functions:
* **fit**(X, truncate=False): Computes the coupling matrix to map the feature space to the 2D map space. X is of shape (n_samples, n_features). The `truncate` parameter determines whether to truncate or zero-pad the data to fit the 2D map.
* **transform**(X): Performs the mapping from feature space to image space.
* **fit_transform**(X, truncate=False): Fits the generator to the data and then performs the transformation.

### Train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classification
```bash
python main.py
```
Refer to the [main.py](https://github.com/rui-yan/TabMap/blob/main/code/main.py) file for details on model training and evaluation. This file also includes k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and comparisons with other classifiers used to generate the results presented in our paper.
