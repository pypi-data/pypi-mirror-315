"""
Marimba Manifest Utilities.

This module provides functionality to create and validate manifests for datasets. It allows for the creation of a
manifest from a directory, validation of a directory against a manifest, and saving/loading manifests to/from files.
The module uses SHA-256 hashing to ensure data integrity and supports multithreaded processing for improved performance.

Imports:
    hashlib: Provides cryptographic hash functions.
    dataclasses: Offers decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods to classes.
    pathlib: Offers classes representing filesystem paths.
    typing: Provides support for type hints.
    distlib.util: Utilities for distribution-related operations.
    rich.progress: Offers rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
    marimba.lib.decorators: Custom decorators for the marimba library.

Classes:
    Manifest: Represents a dataset manifest for validation and integrity checking.

        Create a manifest from a directory.

        This class method generates a manifest by processing files in the specified directory. It computes hashes for
        each file, excluding specified paths and utilizing pre-computed hashes for image set items if provided. The
        method supports multithreaded processing and can display progress using a progress bar.

        Args:
            directory (Path): The root directory to create the manifest from.
            exclude_paths (Iterable[Path] | None): An iterable of paths to exclude from the manifest. Defaults to None.
            image_set_items (dict[str, ImageData] | None): A dictionary of pre-computed image data. Defaults to None.
            progress (Progress | None): A progress bar object to monitor the manifest generation. Defaults to None.
            task (TaskID | None): A task ID associated with the progress bar. Defaults to None.
            logger (logging.Logger | None): A logger object for logging information. Defaults to None.
            max_workers: Maximum number of worker processes to use. If None, uses all available CPU cores.

        Returns:
            Manifest: A new Manifest object containing the processed files and their hashes.

        Raises:
