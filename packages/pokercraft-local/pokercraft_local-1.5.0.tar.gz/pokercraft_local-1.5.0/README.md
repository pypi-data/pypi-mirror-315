# Pokercraft Local

This is a customized visualization tool using downloaded data from Pokercraft in GGNetwork.

Here is working [demo](https://blog.mcdic.net/assets/raw_html/damavaco_performance.html).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12
    - plotly, pandas

I develop most stuffs on WSL and did not tested on other operating systems yet.

## How to run

### 1. Installation

Clone this git repo and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, optionally on virtual environment.
If you want the library files only, you can download from PyPI. Run `pip install pokercraft-local`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # When you cloned the whole repo
pip install pokercraft-local  # When you install library only via pip
```

Or alternatively, you can just download compiled binaries from [Releases page](https://github.com/McDic/pokercraft-local/releases).
This is the best decision when you don't know programming.

### 2. Collect your data files from Pokercraft

Download *"Game summaries"* file by pressing green button on your pokercraft tournament section.
If there are too many tournament records on your account, GGNetwork will prevent you from bulk downloading,
therefore you may have to download separately monthly or weekly records.

After you downloaded, unzip your downloaded `.zip` files, and put all of them under single folder.
The library finds all `GG(blabla).txt` files recursively by default, so it's ok to make multiple folders inside to make better organization of files.

### 3. Running a program

For GUI, if you successfully run the program, you will be able to view something like following image.

![gui_screen](./images/gui_screen.png)

#### 3A. When you cloned this whole repo

For CLI, run `run_cli.py` with some arguments.
If you installed dependencies in your virtual environment, make sure you enabled it before.

```bash
python run_cli.py -d (YOUR_DATA_FOLDER) -o (OUTPUT_FOLDER) -n (YOUR_GG_NICKNAME)
```

For GUI, simply run `run_gui.py` or you can directly download binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/McDic/pokercraft-local/releases) to execute compiled program directly.
When you start the GUI program, then you will be able to view something like above image.
Choose data directory and output directory, input your nickname, then run the process by clicking the bottom button.

```bash
python run_gui.py
```

#### 3B. When you installed libraries via `pip`

Run following Python code to start GUI, and you are good to go.

```python
from pokercraft_local.gui import PokerCraftLocalGUI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    PokerCraftLocalGUI().run_gui()
```

To do something programatic, check `run_cli.py` for example references.

#### 3C. When you directly downloaded releases

Execute `run_gui-(YOUR_OS)/dist/run_gui/run_gui.exe` from downloaded zip file on your local machine.

### 4. Check results

Go to your output folder and open generated `.html` file.
Note that plotly javascripts are included by CDN, so you need working internet connection to properly view it.
