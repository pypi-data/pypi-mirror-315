AiiDA PythonJob
===========================================


`PythonJob` allows users to run Python functions on a remote computer. It is designed to enable users from non-AiiDA communities to run their Python functions remotely and construct workflows with checkpoints, maintaining all data provenance. For instance, users can use ASE's calculator to run a DFT calculation on a remote computer directly.

**Key Features**

1. **Remote Execution**: Seamlessly run Python functions on a remote computer.
2. **User-Friendly**: Designed for users who are not familiar with AiiDA, simplifying the process of remote execution.
3. **Workflow Management**: Construct workflows using WorkGraph with checkpoints, ensuring that intermediate states and results are preserved.
4. **Data Provenance**: Maintain comprehensive data provenance, tracking the full history and transformations of data.
