# title: minip connection protocol
# ---

# This document describes the wire specification of minip.  It is based
# on the following IETF drafts:
#
# 1.[minip: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport
# draft-ietf-minip-transport-29](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-minip-transport-29).
#
# 2. [Using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to Secure minip
# draft-ietf-minip-tls-29](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-minip-tls-29).
#
# The protocol is modeled as a stack of layers. Each layer
# is associated with one or more event types. The highest-level
# events in this stack correspond to the sending and receiving of
# application data, while the lowest-level events correspond
# to UDP datagrams. The layers in the stack are, from top to bottom:
#
# - The application
# - The TLS handshake protocol
# - The minip minip_frame protocol
# - The minip packet protocol
# - minip packet protection
# - UDP
