# 1. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

    #Description: Overwhelming a network or service with a flood of traffic to make 
    # it unavailable to legitimate users.

# see apt_packet.ivy

# 2. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks

    # Description: Similar to DoS but conducted from multiple distributed 
    # sources, making it harder to mitigate.
