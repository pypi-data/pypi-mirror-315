# History

This project was forked from [rapidsai/frigate](https://github.com/rapidsai/frigate). Frigate was originally created as a CLI tool for generating the `README` file for the [RAPIDS Helm Chart](https://github.com/rapidsai/helm-chart).

```{note}
Fun fact `frigate` was built on Thanksgiving and Good Friday 2019 as a hacky side project.
```

Later `frigate` was extended for use within Sphinx documentation, specifically in [dask/dask-kubernetes](https://github.com/dask/dask-kubernetes).

When the RAPIDS Helm Chart was archived development on `frigate` slowed down as it was no longer being used and hadn't gained traction as a community tool. 

Eventually the RAPIDS team decided to archive `frigate`, but the Sphinx extension was alive and kicking in various projects. So it was agreed that the Sphinx extension from `frigate` would be forked to become `sphinx-helm`.
