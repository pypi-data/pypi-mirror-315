## Description

This package is an implementation of common statistical operations and methods for Python users. Although other modules, libraries, and packages already cover much of the content of this package, the expressions and functions are designed to be more user friendly (i.e., written in a more stats-native way).

This package has not yet been optimized for speed and efficency.
