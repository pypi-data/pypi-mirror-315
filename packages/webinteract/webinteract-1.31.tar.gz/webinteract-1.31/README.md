To install and use:

```
pip install webinteract
```

This `pip` command will install the module and a console script
`webinteract` to use the module as a program. If you execute
`webinteract` without a script as an argument, it will open a browser
window and present you a prompt in the terminal where you do web
interaction. Try either the `-h` argument to `webinteract` or type
`help` in the prompt.

See [Web page interaction in
Python](https://blog.pg12.org/web-page-interaction-in-python) for
a more complete documentation of the `webinteract` module.

To-do (planned):
 - Better error handling and improved error messages
 - Better support for data harvesting
