## Why HandGPT?

LLMs are poised to revolutionize productivity across industries, yet realizing practical applications remains challenging. HandGPT focuses on one of the most impactful and scalable AI applicationsâ€”enabling AGI to control devices.

### Importance of Device Control

- **Massive Usage Potential**: Devices like smartphones dominate user interaction time and numbers, presenting unparalleled opportunities for AI.
- **Core AI Application**: Comparable in significance to embodied robotics, device control is a fundamental AI application.
- **Collaborative Innovation**: By uniting developers and fostering innovation, HandGPT aims to accelerate the integration of AI into daily life and generate significant societal and economic value.

## Challenges

While LLMs promise seamless device control, significant challenges remain:

1. **Spatial Understanding**:
   - LLMs exhibit advanced image recognition but lack mature spatial reasoning, critical for device control.

2. **Information Gain**:
   - Human instructions are often simple yet encode complex implicit information.
   - For example, a command like "move from A to B" in autonomous driving implies avoiding accidents, traffic violations, and battery depletion. Device control involves even more diverse and nuanced implicit information.

3. **Logical Reasoning**:
   - Effective device control demands robust reasoning capabilities, but longer reasoning chains increase error rates.
