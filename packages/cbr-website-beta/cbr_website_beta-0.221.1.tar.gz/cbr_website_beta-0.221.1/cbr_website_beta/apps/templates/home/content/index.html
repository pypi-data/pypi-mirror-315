                                Too many boards see cyber security as an IT concern, not a board-level responsibility. This leads to a lack of understanding between boards and their security teams, as board members feel that technical staff are unable to explain key issues in the context of the strategic aims of the organisation.
                                In turn, security teams think that the board does not have the required knowledge to understand them. Ultimately, boards accept that they need to improve their cyber security governance but lack the required confidence to do so.

                                Unfortunately, cyber crime is not going away. In 2022 alone, ransomware attacks increased by 1000%. Leaders wanting to build cyber secure organisations should understand that it starts with them. Leaders are required to become visible advocates of an organisation’s cyber strategy.
                                While leaders will want to ensure their organisation is as prepared as they can be, they should also assume will be attacked. Not if, but when. The issue they need to focus on is how their organisation will react when it happens.

                                    Boards need to be prepared to detect and respond to incidents in order to prevent the attacker from inflicting further damage. Handling an incident effectively whilst in the media spotlight is not easy but it will go a long way to reducing the overall impact on an organisation’s reputation.

                                    An organisation’s incident management framework must ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of their role, especially board members who are likely be representing the organisation in the media. Boards also need to make clear who it is willing to devolve authority to when there is an incident

                                When an organisation has a strong cyber security strategy it is also contributing to its growth strategy. That is because a successful cybers ecurity strategy strengthens the digital trust it has with its customers. Digital trust is the confidence users put in people, technology, and processes to provide a digitally secure environment. That confidence needs to be earned and there is no better way to earn it than by demonstrating than an organisation has a strong cyber security strategy.
