Simulating an astronomical image
================================

Running a realistic image simulation to compare with actual data (as it
is done while constraining the galaxy population) requires a lot of work
to correctly model the background and PSF for all real images. We give
an example how to generate a simple image with constant PSF and
background level. Note that the location of the image is not defined via
a healpy map anymore but by defining the center of the image, the pixel
scale and the number of pixels. We choose values for the image
systematics that are represantative for HSC deep fields.

.. code:: python

    model = GalSBI("Fischbacher+24")
    model(mode="image")

The image is save under
``{catalog_name}_{model_index}_{band}_image.fits`` but can also be
loaded using ``load_images`` directly

.. code:: python

    from astropy.visualization import ImageNormalize, LogStretch
    from astropy.visualization.mpl_normalize import ImageNormalize
    from astropy.visualization import ZScaleInterval, PercentileInterval
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    images = model.load_images()
    image = images["image i"]

    interval = PercentileInterval(95)
    vmin, vmax = interval.get_limits(image)
    norm = ImageNormalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)

    plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray', norm=norm)
