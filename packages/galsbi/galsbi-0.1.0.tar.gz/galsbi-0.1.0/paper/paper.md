# Summary

Large-scale structure surveys measure the shape and positions of millions of galaxies in
order to constrain the cosmological model with high precision.
The resulting large data volume poses a challenge for the analysis of the data, from the
estimation of photometric redshifts to the calibration of shape measurements.
We present GalSBI, a model for the galaxy population, to address these challenges.
This phenomenological model is constrained by observational data using simulation-based
inference (SBI).
The `galsbi` python package provides an easy interface to generate catalogs of galaxies
based on the GalSBI model, including their photometric properties, and to simulate
realistic images of these galaxies using the `UFig` package.

# Statement of need

The analysis of large-scale structure surveys can use realistic galaxy catalogs in
various applications, such as the measurement of photometric redshifts, the calibration
of shape measurements, also under the influence of source blending, or the modelling of
complex selection functions.
A promising approach to tackle all these challenges is to use simulation-based inference
(SBI, see @sbi_review for a review) to constrain a galaxy population model.
GalSBI is a parametric galaxy population model constrained by data using SBI.
Based on one set of these parameters, a galaxy catalog is generated.
This catalog is then rendered into a realisitic astronomical image using the `UFig`
package [@ufig;@ufig2].
The realism of the image relies on two key components: accurate forward modelling of
image systematics such as the point spread function (PSF) and the background noise,
and a realistic galaxy catalog.
For the former, we refer to [@ufig;herbel;@ufig2], while the latter is provided by the
GalSBI model.

To produce a realistic galaxy catalog, the galaxy population model must be constrained
by data.
The first version of the galaxy population model, desribed in @herbel, uses data from
the Suprime-Cam instrument on the Subaru Telescope in the COSMOS field to constrain the
model.
This model was extended by @kacprzak to measure cosmic shear with the Dark Energy
Survey (see [@chang;@bruderer1;@bruderer2] for more details).
@tortorelli1 uses the GalSBI framework to measure the B-band galaxy luminosity function
using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey.
In @tortorelli2, the model is applied to measure narrow-band galaxy properties of the
PAU survey.
[@fagioli1;@fagioli2] use the model to simulate galaxy spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey CMASS sample.
@berner utilizes galaxies sampled from the GalSBI model to produce a realistic
spatial distribution of galaxies using a subhalo-abundance matching approach.
Further refinements to the model are described in @moser, where they use Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) deep fields to constrain the model to high redshift.
The first public release of the phenomenological model, incorporating several model
extensions is described in @fischbacher.
Additionally, @galsbi_sps presents a first version of the GalSBI model based on stellar
population synthesis.

With the constrained model, we can generate realistic intrinsic galaxy catalogs for
various applications.
Rendering the catalogs into realistic astronomical images can help to calibrate the
shape measurements of galaxies, also under the influence of source blending.
Performing source extraction on the simulated images results in realistic measured galaxy
catalogs including the redshift distribution.
Furthermore, the impact of selection effects can be easily studied by applying the
selection function to the catalogs and directly measuring the impact on the observables.

To facilitate the generation of galaxy catalogs and the rendering of images, we provide
the `galsbi` Python package.
The package provides an easy interface to generate catalogs of galaxies based on the
GalSBI model.
The main `galsbi` layer allows the user to generate realistic galaxy catalogs based on
published GalSBI models as described in @moser or @fischbacher.
With just a few lines of code, the user can generate an intrinsic catalog, simulate
astronomical images or run one of the emulators described in @fischbacher to obtain a
measured catalog.
We provide the configuration files of these prepared setups in the package to make it
easy for the user to get started.
However, starting with one of these setups, the user can easily modify the configuration
files to adapt the model to their specific needs.

Furthermore, we provide the catalog generator `ucat` as a subpackage of `galsbi`.
In `ucat`, the user can define their own galaxy population model using a variety of
model choices with different parametrizations.
`ucat` is used by the main `galsbi` layer to generate the catalogs.
However, the user can also use `ucat` directly to generate catalogs based on their own
model.
An overview of the different components described above is given in the Table below.

| **Component** | **Core functionality** | **Details** | **`galsbi` connection** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `galsbi.GalSBI` | A convenience layer to load GalSBI models and create intrinsic and measured catalogs based from them. | Provides predefined configurations to run `ucat` and `UFig` plugins. Configurations can be easily customized. | The main interface for running and customizing workflows in the `galsbi` framework. |
| `galsbi.ucat` | A subpackage implementing the phenomenological galaxy population modeling. | Samples intrinsic galaxy properties like magnitudes, sizes, and ellipticities, and provides the `ucat` plugins | A subpackage in `galsbi` that is also called by the main interface. |
| `UFig` | An external package (see @ufig2) to obtain a measured catalog based from an intrinsic catalog (e.g. generated by GalSBI) | Adds PSF and background to images, can render images and perform source extraction on them or emulate the transfer function from intrinsic to measured catalog. | `UFig` plugins are used in the predefined configuration files of the `galsbi` interface |

Using the model from @fischbacher, sampling a catalog for an HSC deep field simulation
in five bands takes about five seconds.
This is faster than simulating a single band with `UFig`.
However, the runtime varies depending on the simulation area, depth, and, to a lesser
extent, the chosen galaxy population model.


# The GalSBI model overview

In this section, we give a short overview of the GalSBI model.
We focus on the constrained model as described in @fischbacher, however, the package
offers a variety of model choices and parametrizations as described in the documentation.
For interactive versions of the figures, please refer to the corresponding section in the
[documentation](https://cosmo-docs.phys.ethz.ch/galsbi/galpop.html).

## Luminosity Functions

The initial galaxy catalog is sampled from two luminosity functions for the red and
blue galaxy populations.
The luminosity functions are described by a Schechter function with parameters
$\phi^*$, $M^*$, and $\alpha$.
The two parameters $\phi^*$ and $M^*$ vary as a function of redshift, `galsbi` includes
several parametrizations for these functions.
\autoref{fig:lumfunc} shows the blue and red luminosity functions based on the model
from @fischbacher as a function of redshift as well as a simulated image for this
specific choice of luminosity functions.
The luminosity function determines the number of galaxies in a given area and the
absolute luminosity and the redshift of each sampled galaxies.

The redshift evolution of the luminosity function is represented by the color gradient, transitioning from low redshift (blue) to high redshift (yellow). The lower panel displays an HSC deep field-like image generated using the above luminosity functions. An interactive version of this plot, including live updates to the image, is available in the [documentation](https://cosmo-docs.phys.ethz.ch/galsbi/galpop_pheno.html)\label{fig:lumfunc}](lumfunc.png)

## Galaxy Spectra

In order to obtain an apparent magnitude, each galaxy is assigned a spectrum using a
linear combination of the kcorrect templates [@kcorrect], see \autoref{fig:kcorrect}.
The coefficients of the templates are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution such that they
sum to one.
The resulting total spectrum is then normalized to match the absolute magnitude of the
galaxy.
The apparent magnitude is calculated by applying reddening due to galactic extinction,
redshifting the spectrum and integrating it over the filter band.

## Galaxy Morphology

The half-light radius of the galaxies is sampled from a log-normal distribution that
depends on the absolute magnitude and redshift.
\autoref{fig:size} shows the half-light radius as a function of redshift and absolute
magnitude for the blue and red galaxy populations based on the model from @fischbacher.

![Mean and standard deviation of the log-normal size distribution as a function of absolute magnitude $M$ for red and blue galaxies. The redshift evolution of the mean is represented by the color gradient, transitioning from low redshift (blue) to high redshift (yellow). The lower panel displays an HSC deep field-like image generated using the above size model. An interactive version of this plot, including live updates to the image, is available in the [documentation](https://cosmo-docs.phys.ethz.ch/galsbi/galpop_pheno.html)\label{fig:size}](size.png)

The ellipticity of the galaxies is defined as a complex number $e = e_1 + i e_2$.
UFig requires the two components $e_1$ and $e_2$ to render an image.
Depending on the sampling method, the two components are either sampled from gaussian
distributions or the absolute ellipticity $|e| = \sqrt{e^1 + e^2}$ is sampled using
different prescriptions and the phase is sampled uniformly.
\autoref{fig:ellipticity} shows the shape of objects for different ellipticities.

![Shapes for different ellipticity components and different absolute ellipticities.\label{fig:ellipticity}](ellipticities.png)

Finally, each galaxy is assigned a light profile characterized by its Sersic index.
In @fischbacher, the Sersic index is sampled from a beta prime distribution. The
resulting Sersic indices for red and blue galaxies are shown in \autoref{fig:sersic}.

For more details on the available model choices and parametrizations, please refer to
the documentation.
A more comprehensive description of the physical motivation of the model can be found
in @fischbacher.
