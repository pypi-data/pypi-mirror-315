    "In the _experimental_ fit-and-count backend (which can be run by providing the arguments `obs` (`RooFit` `RooAbsReal` type) and `pdf` (`RooFit` `RooAbsPdf` type), the count histograms are filled manually with the values and errors taken from the yields of the fits.\n",
    "The _experimental_ _sWeight_ backend runs more similarly to the standard histogram filling; wherein global fits are first performed to obtain per-event _sWeights_, which are then passed to the histiogram filling.\n",
