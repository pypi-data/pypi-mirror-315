Cross-check submodule reference
=========================

.. currentmodule:: triggercalib.crosscheck

The cross-check submodule provides utilities for validating trigger efficiency calculations, particularly focusing on sWeight-based methods.
It includes two complementary approaches:
factorisation tests and Kendall's Tau correlation tests.
We would like to thank Hans Dembinski for providing these tests in the `sweights package <https://github.com/sweights/sweights/blob/main/doc/notebooks/factorization_test.ipynb>`_
