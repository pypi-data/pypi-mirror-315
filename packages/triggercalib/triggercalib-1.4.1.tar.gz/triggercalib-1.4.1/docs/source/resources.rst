Resources
=========

This page is a dedicated repository for literature, presentations and online documentation on the LHCb trigger, TISTOS and TriggerCalib.
The resources listed here are not exhaustive, but should provide a good starting basis from which to read further into each topic.

A CERN computing account and LHCb e-group permissions may be needed to access some of the resources.
