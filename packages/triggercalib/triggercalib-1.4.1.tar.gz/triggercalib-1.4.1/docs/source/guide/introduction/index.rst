Introduction to trigger efficiencies
====================================

This section introduces the relevant background required to understand trigger efficiency calculations.
First, the Run 3 LHCb trigger and dataflow are briefly introduced.
Then the data-driven TISTOS method is introduced and propagation of uncertainties on trigger efficiencies is discussed.
Finally, the mitigation of background is approached, with three methods presented: sideband subtraction, fit-and-count, and `sPlot`.
