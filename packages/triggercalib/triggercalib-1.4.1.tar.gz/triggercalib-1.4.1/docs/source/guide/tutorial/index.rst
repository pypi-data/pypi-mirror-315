Tutorial: calculating trigger efficiencies with TriggerCalib
============================================================

The following tutorial works through from the simplest case of a trigger efficiency calculation, a simple efficiency of a single HLT1 line, up to a complex selection involving multiple lines at both.
The tutorials are formed from the Jupyter notebooks in ``lhcb-rta/triggercalib/notebooks/``, which can be worked through alongside the written tutorials here.
Tutorials for more advanced functionality, e.g., `sWeight` factorisation cross-checks can be found in :ref:`advanced`.
Requests for additional tutorials are very welcome and should be opened as issues (see \":ref:`_issues`\").
