Calculating the efficiency of a single HLT1 line
================================================

As a simple example, the efficiency of `Hlt1TrackMVA` will be calculated from a preselected sample of Block 1 data selected as :math:`B^+\to J/\psi\left(\mu^+\mu^-\right)K^+`.
This sample can be found at ``root://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/wg/rta/WP4/TriggerCalib/Bu2JpsiK_Jpsi2MuMu_block1_ntuple.root``.
We start by using a sideband subtraction approach.

Sideband subtraction approach
-----------------------------
The configuration of `HltEff` to run with sideband subtraction is fairly straightforward:

.. code-block:: python

    hlt_eff = HltEff(
        "simple_example",
        "root://eoslhcb.cern.ch//eos/lhcb/wg/rta/WP4/TriggerCalib/Bu2JpsiK_Jpsi2MuMu_block1_ntuple.root:Tuple/DecayTree",
        tos="Hlt1TrackMVA",
        tis=["Hlt1TrackMVA", "Hlt1TwoTrackMVA"],
        particle="B",
        binning={
            "B_PT" : {
                "bins" : [
                    n*1e3 for n in (
                        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                        14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25
                    )
                ]
            }
        },
        sideband={
            "B_DTF_Jpsi_MASS": {
                "signal": [5280 - 55, 5280 + 55]
                "sideband": [
                    [5280 - 150, 5280 - 55],
                    [5280 + 55, 5280 + 150],
                ]
            }
        }
    )

A name, sample and tree are passed in the first two arguments.
The TIS and TOS selections for the efficiencies are then defined, along with the particle of interest.
The binning scheme is laid out in the control variableâ€”in this case ``B_PT``.
Finally, the sideband is defined based on the full range of the window and the inner/outer edges of the sideband.
In this case, the sidebands are defined as 5130-5225 MeV and 5335-5430 MeV.
