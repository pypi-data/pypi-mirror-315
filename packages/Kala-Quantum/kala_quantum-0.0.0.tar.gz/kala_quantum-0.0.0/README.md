# Kala_Quantum

A quantum-powered chatbot framework leveraging quantum state manipulation for advanced conversational capabilities.

## Features

- Quantum state representation and manipulation.
- Integration of standard quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, etc.).
- Support for multi-qubit systems via tensor products.
- Chatbot framework with customizable response mapping.
- Training module for quantum models.

## Installation

You can install the `Kala_Quantum` package via pip:

```bash
pip install Kala-Quantum
```

## Usage

### Quantum State Manipulation

```python
from Kala_Quantum import QuantumState, QuantumGates

# Create a quantum state |0>
qs = QuantumState([1, 0, 0, 0])

# Apply Hadamard gate
qs.apply_gate(QuantumGates.H)
print("State after Hadamard:", qs)

# Measure the state
outcome = qs.measure()
print("Measurement outcome:", outcome)
```

### Quantum Chatbot

```python
from Kala_Quantum import QuantumChatbot

# Initialize the chatbot
chatbot = QuantumChatbot()

# Define user inputs and responses
user_inputs = ["hello", "help", "info", "goodbye"]
chatbot.initialize_state(user_inputs)
chatbot.add_response_map({
    0: "Hello! How can I assist you?",
    1: "I'm here to help!",
    2: "Here's some information for you.",
    3: "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
})

# Simulate conversation
user_message = "hello"
response = chatbot.respond(user_inputs)
print("Chatbot response:", response)
```
