Main (and so far, only) developer for the package is:
Piero Campalani <piero.campalani@eurac.edu>

The whole idea of a package for the computation and analysis
of climate indices of future climate projection started from
Alice Crespi <alice.crespi@eurac.edu>, which is also the mastermind
behind the definition and tuning of the preconfigured set of climate indices 
available that are available under:

    ./src/climdex/etc/indices.ini
