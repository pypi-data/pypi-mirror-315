Overview
========

This library simulates the process of a board game. The goal of the simulation is to predict the game 
process statistics depending on various parameters. From this, we can conclude which parameters are 
desirable to set in order to play effectively in a real game. 

We design a simple board game as an reinforcement learning environment and try to solve this.

Installation
============

Simply install with :code:`pip`:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install rbgame


.. warning::

    If you want to animate the game process with pre-trained models, please follow steps in
    our `documention <https://robotic-board-game.readthedocs.io/en/latest/animation.html>`_.
