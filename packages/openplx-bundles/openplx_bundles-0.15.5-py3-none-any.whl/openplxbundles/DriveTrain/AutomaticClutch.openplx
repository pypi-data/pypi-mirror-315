AutomaticClutch is ManualClutch:
    .doc: """
Extends the manual clutch with an automatic engage/disengage feature.
A engagement_time constant determines how long it takes to go from fully
open to fully engaged. The boolean ClutchEngageInput is used to engage and
disengage the clutch.

When using the automatic feature the engagement_fraction parameter is irrelavant.

The automatic clutch is engaged by sending true on the engage_input, and disengaged by sending false.
initially_engaged will tell wether the clutch is engaged or not before any signal has been sent.
