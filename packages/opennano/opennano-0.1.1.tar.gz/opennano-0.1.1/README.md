## Open Nano

Open Nano is a free open source python package developed to address a lack of python-based tools for analysing Nanostring GeoMx DSP data.

From your dcc, pkc, and metadata files, you can:
-  create an AnnData object of your data 
-  perform quality control and normalisation steps
-  do a differential gene expression analysis
-  look at spatial autocorralation with Moran's I statistic
-  perform UMAP and tSNE clustering

Benchmarked against GeoMxTools R package and DESeq2.
