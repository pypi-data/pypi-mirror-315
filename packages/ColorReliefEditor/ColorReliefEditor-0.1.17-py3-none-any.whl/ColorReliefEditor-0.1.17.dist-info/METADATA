# Color Relief Editor

<img width="622" alt="sample" src="https://github.com/corb555/ColorReliefEditor/blob/main/docs/images/color%20sample.png?raw=true">

## Overview
This application uses Digital Elevation files and GDAL tools to create hillshade and color relief images which 
are combined into a final relief image. All settings, including colors and parameters, are set directly 
in the app and the app executes GDAL utilities to generate the images.  

**Features**:

* **Color editor for color relief settings:**
  * Edit settings and see fast preview 
  * Color palette selector for each color
  * Undo to back out unwanted changes
  * Insert row with interpolation
  * Rescale to rescale all elevations
  * Import any standard GDAL color setting file 
* **Hillshade Settings editor:**
  * Edit settings and see fast preview
* **Final relief build:**
  * Uses composite multiply to cleanly merge the hillshade and color relief for the final image.
  * All settings are stored in a configuration file.
  * Does the minimum steps needed to generate the image (only rebuilds items with config changes).
  * Uses multiple processors in parallel to boost performance.
  * Links to external viewer (QGIS or GIMP)
  * Copy file to map server
* **Elevation Files**
  * Download files and simply drop and drop them to Elevation Tab
  * Optionally sets the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
  * Store their source URL and License
