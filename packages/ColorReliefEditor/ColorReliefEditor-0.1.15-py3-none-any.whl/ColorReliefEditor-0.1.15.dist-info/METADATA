# Color Relief Editor
## Overview

This application uses Digital Elevation files and GDAL tools to create hillshade and color relief images which 
are combined into a final relief image. All settings, including colors and parameters, are set directly 
in the app and GDAL utilities are automatically executed to generate the images.  

Key Features:

* Color editor for color relief settings:
  * Fast preview.
  * Undo to back out unwanted changes.
  * Insert row with interpolation
  * Rescale to rescale all elevations
* Hillshade Settings editor with fast preview
* Final relief build:
  * Uses composite multiply to cleanly merge the hillshade and color relief for the final image.
  * Stores all settings, including DEM file sources, in a single configuration file.
  * Rebuilds only the necessary parts when settings are updated.
  * Uses multiple processors in parallel to boost performance.
  * Links to external viewer (QGIS or GIMP)
  * Copy file to map server
* Elevation Files
  * Download files and simply drop and drop them to Elevation Tab to add to configuration
  * Optionally sets the Coordinate Reference System (CRS).

 For a great introduction to GDAL and shaded relief, see Robert Simmons'
explanation [here](https://medium.com/@robsimmon/a-gentle-introduction-to-gdal-part-5-shaded-relief-ec29601db654).

## Initial Setup

- **Dependencies**
- [ ] **yq:** Used to parse the config file. 
- [ ] **make:** Make, used to determine what needs to be built
- [ ] **GDAL:** Install GDAL, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library 

### Installing Dependencies on Mac:

Homebrew and Anaconda are two popular Mac package managers.  
You can use them to install the three above dependencies. Generally, you should use one or the other package manager
and not both. Gdal is a LARGE package and will take a while to install.
Note - this has not been tested with Anaconda.

### Installing Dependencies on Linux / WSL:

## Create a Color Relief Image

1. **Launch ColorReliefEditor**
   - Start your systems Command shell / Terminal and type:
   ```shell
   ColorReliefEditor
   ```
2. **Project Tab** - Create New Project:
   - To start a new project, click New in the Project Tab. A dialog will appear where you can specify the project folder
   location. A sample color ramp and settings file will be automatically generated within this folder.
3. **Elevation Tab** - Add Digital Elevation files:
   - Click on **Download**.  This will bring you to the EarthExplorer
   - Select Digital Elevation under the Data Sets tab and choose GMTED2010. Download  gmted_mea files for your area.
   - In your system's Finder/File Manager, go to Downloads, drag and drop the TIF files to the blue box labelled _Drag Elevation 
     File Here_.
4. **Hillshade Tab** - Tune Hillshade parameters:
    - Try different Shading Algorithms and Z Factor settings. 
    - Click Preview to see a preview.  The first time this is run may take a long time.
5. **Color Tab** - Tune color parameters:
    - Try different Color and Elevations settings. 
    - Click Preview to see a preview.
6. **Relief Tab** - Generate final full size image:
    - Click Create to generate a full size image
    - Click View to view the image in QGIS or GIMP
    - Click Publish to copy the file to "Publish To" destination
