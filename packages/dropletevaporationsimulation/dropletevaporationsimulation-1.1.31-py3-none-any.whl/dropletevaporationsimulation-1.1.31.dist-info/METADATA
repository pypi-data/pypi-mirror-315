This project simulates the evaporation and dynamics of an n-Decane droplet in a heated airflow, using both the D² Law and Infinite Liquid Conductivity models. It visualizes droplet diameter, temperature, velocity, and axial position over time. 

It can be used to compute the minimal axial length of a combustion chamber to ensure full envaporation of the droplet.

Droplet properties can be modified in src/constants.py to simulate the vaporization of desired fuel.

## Features

- **D² Law Model** and **Infinite Liquid Conductivity Model** simulations
- Plots for droplet diameter, temperature, axial velocity and position
- Adjustable parameters and configurations for droplet properties and environmental conditions
