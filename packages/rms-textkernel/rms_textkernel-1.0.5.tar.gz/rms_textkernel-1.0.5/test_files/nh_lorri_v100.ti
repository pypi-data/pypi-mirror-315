LORRI Instrument Kernel
==============================================================================

   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the New Horizons LOng Range
   Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI).


Version and Date
----------------------------------------------------------

   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the LORRI I-kernel might have an entry as follows:

         TEXT_KERNEL_ID += 'NEWHORIZONS_LORRI V1.0.0 21-FEBRUARY-2007 IK'

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH,
   CSPICE routine furnsh_c, and IDL routine cspice_furnsh load SPICE kernels
   as shown below:

   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)

           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )

   C (CSPICE)

           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )

   ICY (IDL)

           cspice_furnsh, 'kernel_name'

   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GCPOOL, and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.

   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.


Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------

   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF New Horizons spacecraft ID number (-98)
   followed by a NAIF three digit ID code for the LORRI instrument.

   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the LORRI boresight direction in the
   LORRI frame (``NH_LORRI'' -- see [5] ) is specified by:

           INS-98300_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.

   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.


LORRI description
----------------------------------------------------------

   From [4]:

   ``The instrument that provides the highest spatial resolution on New
   Horizons is LORRI - short for Long Range Reconnaissance Imager - which
   consists of a telescope with a 8.2-inch (20.8-centimeter) aperture that
   focuses visible light onto a charge coupled device (CCD). LORRI has a
   very simple design; there are no filters or moving parts. Near the time
   of closest approach, LORRI will take images of Pluto's surface at
   football-field sized resolution, resolving features approximately 100
   yards or 100 meters across.''

   From [1]:

   ``The Long Range Reconnaissance Imager, LORRI, is a modest aperture
   (200 mm), narrow-angle camera capable of producing high-resolution
   imagery.  The LORRI will provide imagery of Pluto-Charon, beginning 90
   days prior to encounter. From 75 days regarding before closest approach,
   LORRI will provide resolution of Pluto beyond that achievable using HST.
     .
     .
     .
   LORRI imager consists of a 208 mm aperture Ritchie-Chrétien telescope
   made of silicon carbide.  The telescope is f/12.75, and feeds an
   unfiltered, 1024 x 1024 frame transfer CCD.  The effective band-pass is
   primarily limited by the CCD response to 350 to 850 nm.  There is a long
   composite baffle running the length of the instrument, and smaller
   baffles at the outside of the secondary and inside of the primary.  The
   assembly is mounted to the spacecraft via 3 titanium legs.
     .
     .
     .
   LORRI operations consist of imaging at Jupiter, Pluto/Charon, and one to
   three Kuiper Belt Objects.  Additionally, various calibration images and
   functional tests will be performed.''

   From [3]:

   ``The LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is intended to complement
   the PERSI/MVIC wide angle, medium resolution imagers.  LORRI is
   controlled independently of PERSI/MVIC. It will provide higher resolution
   imagery with a much narrower field-of-view and contributes a measure of
   redundancy to the mission.  Its boresight is aligned to within 0.1 deg of
   PERSI/MVIC to support coordinated operations when operated in their
   "framing mode".  The long-range capability of LORRI will permit the
   receipt of high-resolution observations of Pluto-Charon at least 75 days
   before their encounter and of the Kuiper-Belt Objects (KBOs).
     .
     .
     .
   LORRI is a panchromatic visible imager with an angular resolution of 5
   rad/pixel and a field-of-view (FOV) of 0.29 deg x 0.29 deg.  It consists
   of a 20-cm aperture, f/13 telescope imaging onto a CCD focal plane. The
   combined mass of the telescope structure, mirrors, supporting
   electronics, and aperture door is 8.593 Kg.  To reduce unwanted stray
   light, the telescope is heavily baffled.  LORRI is fixed mounted inside
   the spacecraft structure within a baffle tube protruding through the
   spacecraft structure.  An aperture door provides contamination protection
   during ground operation, launch, and early cruise.''

   The LORRI optics inverts images in both the Y and Z directions, so that the
   projection of these spacecraft axes onto the LORRI CCD will look like the
   following: (Note that we are looking INTO the LORRI telescope in the
   diagram below, whereas above we were looking outwards, hence the position
   of the +Z axis does not appear to have changed when in fact it has flipped).

   Taken from [9], we have the following coordinate system definition for the
   LORRI frame:

   The -Z axis in instrument coordinates is defined to be the boresight and
   is approximately aligned with the spacecraft -X axis. The Y axis in
   instrument coordinates is approximately aligned with the spacecraft -Z axis
   and is in the direction of increasing rows. The X axis in instrument
   coordinates is approximately aligned with the spacecraft -Y axis and is in
   the direction of increasing columns.


LORRI Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------

   From [10], the LORRI FOV is 0.2907 deg square.

   Since LORRI's angular separation in Y is 0.2907 deg, looking up the +Y
   axis in the instrument frame we have: (Note we are arbitrarily choosing
   vectors that terminate in the Z=-1 plane.)

   Since LORRI's field of view is square, a similar computation yields the
   Y component.
