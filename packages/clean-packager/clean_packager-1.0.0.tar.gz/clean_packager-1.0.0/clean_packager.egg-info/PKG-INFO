- **Streamline Package Structure**: Keeps only essential files like source code, `README`, `LICENSE`, and setup scripts.
- **Customizable Cleanup**: Define specific file patterns or directories to exclude from your package.
- **Pre-Publish Checks**: Validates the package structure before upload.
- **Safe Mode**: Preview changes before permanently deleting files.
