### 5. **Build Your Library**

Now, you can proceed to build and package your library:

1. **Install `setuptools` and `wheel`** if you havenâ€™t yet:

    ```bash
    pip install setuptools wheel
    ```

2. **Build your package**:

    ```bash
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    ```

3. **Upload to PyPI** using `twine`:

    ```bash
    pip install twine
    twine upload dist/*
    ```

After following these steps, your package will be published and available for installation via `pip`!
