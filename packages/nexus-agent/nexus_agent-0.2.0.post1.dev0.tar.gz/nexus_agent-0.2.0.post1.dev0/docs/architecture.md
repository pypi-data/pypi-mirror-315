- Manages tool execution

### Interface Layer

```
src/nexus_agent/interface.py
```

- Streamlit-based web interface
- User input processing
- Response rendering
- Model selection UI
- Configuration management

### Tool System

```
src/nexus_agent/tools/
```

#### AI Tools (`tools/ai/`)

- Image generation
- AI model integration
- Future ML capabilities

#### Core Tools (`tools/core/`)

- Model selection
- System configuration
- Performance monitoring

#### Development Tools (`tools/dev/`)

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**

   ```
   Web Interface → Interface Layer → Agent System
   ```

2. **Processing**

   ```
   Agent System → Model API → Tool Execution → Response Generation
   ```

3. **Response**

   ```
   Response Generation → Interface Layer → Web Interface
   ```
