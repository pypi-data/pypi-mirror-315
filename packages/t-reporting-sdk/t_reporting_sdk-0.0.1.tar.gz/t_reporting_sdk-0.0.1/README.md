# Reporting SDK

The Reporting SDK is a lightweight SDK utilized by ThoughtfulAI agents to report information about the individual 
units of execution an Agent performs. 

For example, in the context of EVA, an individual unit would be "Was the Patient eligible for the Payer given 
the patient history & insurance".
