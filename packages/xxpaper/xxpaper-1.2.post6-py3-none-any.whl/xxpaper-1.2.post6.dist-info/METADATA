XXPaper
=======

Installation:

	     pip install xxpaper

XXPaper generates artfiles representing charters, privates,
shares, station markers, trains and (linear) stock markets (2D stock
markets coming later) as defined by a configuration passed on the
command line.  All art is made using a format which is friendly to
die-cutting.

This is now version 1.x of XXPaper.  It is not backward compatible
with v0.x versions of XXPaper.  Many things are different.  Some of
them are better.  Maybe a few things are worse.  Sample configuration
files can be found in the "samples" directory of the source tree.
Their number will grow over time.

Note: XXPaper is now a Python3 project.  It may still work under
Python 2, but that is neither tested or expected.
