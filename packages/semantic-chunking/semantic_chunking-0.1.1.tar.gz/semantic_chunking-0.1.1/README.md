# Semantic Chunking

Semantic Chunking is a Python library for segmenting text into meaningful chunks using embeddings from Sentence Transformers.

## Features

- Splits text into semantic chunks using cosine similarity
- Configurable chunk size and similarity thresholds
- Based on `sentence-transformers`

## Installation

```bash
pip install semantic-chunking
```

### USAGE

```python

from semantic_chunking import SemanticChunker

def test_semantic_chunker():
    text = """Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn.
    Deep learning is a more specialized version of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
    These advanced algorithms can process complex patterns and make intelligent decisions with minimal human intervention.
    The applications of machine learning are vast, ranging from image recognition to natural language processing."""

    chunker = SemanticChunker(model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2', max_chunk_size=128, similarity_threshold=0.3)
    chunks = chunker.semantic_chunk(text)

    print("Semantic Chunks:")
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks, 1):
        print(f"Chunk {i}: {chunk}")
        print(f"Words: {len(chunk.split())}\n")
