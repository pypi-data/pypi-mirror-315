1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash

    ```

## Usage

### Verifying Installation

To verify the installation, run a simple script to import the package:

```python
from sage_bbb.services.client import BigBlueButtonClient

# Initialize the client
bbb_client = BigBlueButtonClient(
    "https://your-bbb-server.com/bigbluebutton/api/",
    "your-security-salt",
)

# Check connection
connection_status = bbb_client.check_connection()
print(f"Connection Status: {connection_status}")
```

### Creating a Meeting

1. **Import the necessary modules**:
    ```python
    from sage_bbb.services.client import BigBlueButtonClient
    ```

2. **Initialize the client**:
    ```python
    bbb_client = BigBlueButtonClient(
        "http://your-bbb-server.com/bigbluebutton/api/",
        "your-security-salt",
    )
    ```

3. **Check the connection**:
    ```python
    connection_status = bbb_client.check_connection()
    print(f"Connection Status: {connection_status}")
    ```

4. **Create a new meeting**:
    ```python
    new_meeting = bbb_client.meetings.create_meeting(
        name="Test Meeting",
        meeting_id="random-9887584",
        attendee_pw="ap",
        moderator_pw="mp",
        record=True,  # Enable recording
        autoStartRecording=True,
        allowStartStopRecording=True
    )
    print(f"New Meeting: {new_meeting}")
    ```

5. **Join the meeting as a moderator**:
    ```python
    join_url_moderator = bbb_client.meetings.join_meeting(
        meeting_id="random-9887584",
        full_name="Moderator",
        password="mp"
    )
    print(f"Join URL (Moderator): {join_url_moderator}")
    ```

6. **Join the meeting as an attendee**:
    ```python
    join_url_attendee = bbb_client.meetings.join_meeting(
        meeting_id="random-9887584",
        full_name="Attendee",
        password="ap"
    )
    print(f"Join URL (Attendee): {join_url_attendee}")
    ```
