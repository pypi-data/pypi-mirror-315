# What does this

Linked Services was made by [4geeks.com](https://4geeks.com) to manage communication between multiple services and microservices, it manages specifically communications between pairwise services, so, if only two services share the same key, a request just could has two emisors, the other service and itself. It was designed to replace the signature algorithms because them are significally slower.
