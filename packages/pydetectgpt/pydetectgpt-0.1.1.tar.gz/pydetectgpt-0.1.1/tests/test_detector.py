    "The main problem the authors are trying to address is that Large Language Models require large computational resources to use. This means that as a common setup we see companies deploying GPU clusters which act as a cloud server to generate responses when a user presents a query. Aside from the vast resources needed to set up a GPU cluster this approach has 2 main downsides: sending queries over the internet via an API exposes usersâ€™ private data and results in additional latency when generating responses"
