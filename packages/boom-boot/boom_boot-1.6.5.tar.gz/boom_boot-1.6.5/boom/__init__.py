"""This module provides classes and functions for creating, displaying,
and manipulating boot loader entries complying with the Boot Loader
Specification.

The ``boom`` package contains global definitions, functions to configure
the Boom environment, logging infrastructure for the package and a
``Selection`` class used to select one or more ``OsProfile``,
``HostProfile``, ``BootEntry``, or ``BootParams`` object according to
specified selection criteria.

Individual sub-modules provide interfaces to the various components of
Boom: operating system and host profiles, boot loader entries and boot
parameters, the boom CLI and procedural API and a simple reporting
module to produce tabular reports on Boom objects.

See the sub-module documentation for specific information on the
classes and interfaces provided, and the ``boom`` tool help output and
manual page for information on using the command line interface.
