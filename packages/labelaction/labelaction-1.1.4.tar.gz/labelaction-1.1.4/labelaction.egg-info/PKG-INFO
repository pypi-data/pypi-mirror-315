# Animal Behavior Annotation Tool(labelaction)

This is a GUI-based tool for annotating animal behavior in video files. Built using Python and PyQt5, this application allows users to load a video, navigate through frames, and label different behaviors for multiple subjects (referred to as "pigeons" in this tool).

## Features

- **Simultaneous annotation of behaviors and postures**: Users can annotate both behaviors (e.g. feeding, drinking, etc.) and postures (e.g. standing, lying down, etc.) of pigeons during video playback, and each annotation can be done independently.
- **Timeline visualization**: The program provides a visual timeline for each pigeon to show the behavior and posture annotations for quick viewing and editing.

- **Video frame navigation**: the user can use buttons or shortcut keys (such as 'D' and 'S') to quickly advance or rewind video frames for easy and precise labeling.

- **Color coding**: Different behaviors and gestures are identified using different colors, making annotation more intuitive and allowing users to quickly identify information by color.

- **Export function**: Users can export annotation data to CSV file, supporting two formats: original annotation and sorted annotation data, which is convenient for subsequent data analysis and processing.

- **Multi-pigeon support**:  the program allows independent annotation of multiple pigeons for complex experimental scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (>= 3.6)
- **Libraries**: The following libraries are required:
  - `PyQt5`
  - `OpenCV`
  - `pandas`

## Update log
'1.1.4' Updated the review function. Now you can see the bounding box and corresponding ID, behavior and posture of each pigeon in the video area.

'1.1.3' Add some functionality
- Support undo when marking, press ctrl+z.
- Click the annotated area of ​​the status bar to display the annotated information, such as the start frame, end frame, etc.
- Support annotation review and modification
- Print annotate operation log to the console

'1.1.2' Modify the behavior list and posture list

'1.1.1' fix some bugs, add posture "Tail up" and the posture "lying down" was changed to "Squatting"

'1.1.0'    
- Supports simultaneous annotation of actions and gestures in videos.  
- Export similar to mot format, export each frame's information to csv file, replace no behavior or gesture with -1
- Optimize GUI interface and functional details to improve user usability

'1.0.2' automatically install dependent packages

'1.0.1' fix some bugs

'1.0.0' first release
