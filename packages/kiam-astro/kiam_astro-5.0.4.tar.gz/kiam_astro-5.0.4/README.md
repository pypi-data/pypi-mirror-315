# About

KIAM Astrodynamics Toolbox is an astrodynamical toolbox written in Fortran and Python in Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, Moscow, Russia.
The toolbox contains astronomical constants, physical parameters of celestial bodies, right-hand side of equations of motion in various models, methods for solving ODEs, routines for transformation variables, coordinate systems, and units.
The toolbox also contains a high-level class for trajectory models.

## Installation

`pip install kiam_astro` is the recommended way for installing the toolbox.

One can also download the toolbox using the Releases section on the right.

## Versions

Current version: 3.3.

The next version 3.4 will be released in August, 2023.

## The toolbox files

The main toolbox files are in the `kiam_astro` directory:

- `kiam.py ` is the main file containing the interface functions for accessing the fortran-compiled modules listed below.

- `FKIAMToolbox.cp39-win_amd64.pyd`, `FKIAMToolbox.cpython-39-darwin.so`, `FKIAMToolbox.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` are python modules containing compiled Fortran routines. It is assumed that users will not import or use these files directly.

- `trajectory.py ` is a high–level class for designing trajectories, it facilitates the propagation of trajectories, transformation of coordinate systems, variables, and units.

- `JPLEPH` is a file with ephemerides of celestial bodies, used by functions in fortran-compiled modules, developed by NASA JPL. This file contains ephemeris D430, which can also be downloaded independently from the site https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov /.

- `dll files` are auxiliary files for the Fortran–Python interface from Intel(r) Visual Fortran Compiler, which can also be downloaded separately.

- `images` contains images used by the toolbox, e.g., the Earth's and Moon's surfaces.

The `examples` directory contains some typical examples of using the toolbox.

## System requirements
