# Installation
Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin/).
Install via `pip install mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin` or add it to your `requirements.txt`.

# Usage
## Setup in MkDocs
Activate the plugin in `mkdocs.yml`, but **note** that this plugin has to be located before plugins, that replace wikilinks by markdown links. Currently just wikilinks like `[[Link#Anchor|Custom Text]]` are supported.
```
plugins:
  - obsidian-interactive-graph

extra_javascript:
  - https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js
  - https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts/dist/echarts.min.js
  - assets/javascripts/interactive_graph.js

extra_css:
  - assets/stylesheets/interactive_graph.css
```

## Graph Javascript by Apache ECharts
A `interactive_graph.js` example can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daxcore/mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin/main/docs/ObsidianVault/assets/javascripts/interactive_graph.js) and must be located into the docs directory under `docs/YourSiteName/assets/javascripts/interactive_graph.js`.

Beginning from version 0.3.0 the default graph inside the sidebar was minimized to egdes related to the current page only. The previous behavior can be restored by setting `global` to `true` at line `draw_graph_sidebar(myChart, global=false)` at top of javascript file.

# Docker
Adapt the `.env` and `mkdocs.yml` files to your needs. `DEV=ON` will rebuild the `mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin` from local files. If `DEV != ON` the upstream packages of PyPI will be used. Build and start the Docker container via `docker compose up --build [-d]`.
